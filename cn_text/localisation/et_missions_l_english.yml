We must choose whether to embrace this change or to stick to our roots."
 strong_economy_gay_title:0 "Strong Economy"
 strong_economy_gay_desc:0 "Byeonhan is a small nation, and all of our neighbours are both larger and stronger than us. Our one advantage is the plentiful resources that our land provides, especially iron. To secure our survival and, we hope, our eventual expansion into a larger power, we must make better use of these resources, and create an economy capable of supporting our future conquests."
 byeonhan_army_gay_title:0 "A Byeonhan Army"
 byeonhan_army_gay_desc:0 "Up until this point, we have relied on braves, who support us for fame, to protect their tribes, or because their elders have told them to come to us. This system will simply not do with the rapid changes in society, including rapid urbanisation and increased use of iron weapons and armour. It is vital that we create a conscript force, similar to the Chinese, and institute standard training and drill. Only by doing so, and increasing the number of soldiers available to us, can we hope to survive the coming centuries."

 yamato_allies_are_all_gay_desc:0 "Jin and Yamato people were once one and the same. While we in Byeonhan have been influenced significantly by arrivals from the north, many old customs are still shared between us and the Yamato, and a portion of our population even still speaks the same language. By deepening the ties between ourselves and the Yamato, we reduce our reliance on the Chinese, and strengthen our position within Korea."

 diplomats_in_japan_have_turned_gay_desc:0 "While Yamato is a powerful nation, we should not rely on them exclusively. Diplomats visiting the Yamato have made us aware of many tribes such as the Kumaso, Hayato, and Thuchigumo, at least some of whom would make valuable allies and trading partners."

 warrior_king_i_am_a_mature_adult_gay_desc:0 "While many things are changing in Byeonhan, the expectation for leaders to be brave warriors has not. In order to replace our loose confederation with a kingdom, we must have a king respected for standing with his men in battle, for the men of Jin wont bleed for a man who wont bleed for them."
 military_advisors_gay_title:0 "Military Advisors"
 military_advisors_gay_desc:0 "The fall of Joseon came as a surprise to all of the Samhan, showing the extent of Han military superiority over their Korean counterparts. As the furthest kingdom from the Chinese in the north, we have also been the last to receive many of the innovations brought by the Chinese. This must change. We should seek out skilled men from the north, able to reform our military and society."
 iron_trade_so_gay_title:0 "Iron Trade"
 iron_trade_so_gay_desc:0 "Our territory is extremely rich in iron, to the extent of iron ingots being used as a form of currency in international trade. We should encourage this trade, expanding our mines so that we can obtain more of the precious objects and technologies arriving from elsewhere."
 trade_fleet_gay_title:0 "Trade Fleet"
 trade_fleet_gay_desc:0 "For centuries we have supplied the Han commanderies to the north, Yamato Japan, and the rest of Korea with iron. The rise of wokou pirates, however, has complicated this trade, especially with Japan. We should build a navy capable of suppressing such acts of piracy, and protecting the trade routes which are the lifeblood of our country."
 bringer_civilisation_mhn_title:0 "Bringer of Civilisation"
 bringer_civilisation_mhn_desc:0 "Baekje would be among the leading nations responsible for spreading continental culture in Japan. The people of Mahan are themselves relatively recent recipients of this culture, yet by building relationships with Japanese nations, we can begin the process of transferring knowledge to them, ensuring that we have firm allies willing to defend our interests for centuries to come."
 reformation_mhn_title:0 "Reformation"
 reformation_mhn_desc:0 "The reopening of international trade with the conquest of Wiman Joseon by the Han has brought many significant changes to our society. From a loose confederation of fifty four different statelets of up to ten thousand families each, we have become a more traditional kingdom divided between just two power centres: Baekje and Mokji. We can try to resist these changes, remaining a tribal confederation and preventing a rift from forming with the northern states around Baekje, however to do so would bring terrible consequences, and likely consign us to a footnote in history."
 phoenicia_east_mhn_title:0 "Phoenicia of the East"
 phoenicia_east_mhn_desc:0 "Historians would come to call Baekje, a member of our confederation, the Phoenicia of East Asia due to its naval prowess. The Mahan coast is long, with many good places for docks and shipyards. So far, however, our naval power is underwhelming. We should make use of our geography and build a true fleet, able to promote our interests along all the points of the compass, and in both Japan and China."
 naval_advisors_mhn_title:0 "Naval Advisors"
 naval_advisors_mhn_desc:0 "Our new fleet is the pride of our nation, but with few experienced sailors and no admirals, it will take considerable investment to convert ships into a true fighting force to project power overseas. To speed the development of the navy, we should seek out experienced naval men, perhaps from China or Japan, who can reform the force."
 animal_husbandry_mhn_title:0 "Animal Husbandry"
 animal_husbandry_mhn_desc:0 "The Sanguo Zhi records that our people have plentiful horses and oxen, but that we do not know how to ride them and that we make use of them only to accompany the dead. We should make efforts to change this by importing larger and stronger horses from the Xianbei in the north and breeding them here for our armies. By breeding only the best oxen generation after generation, we can also greatly increase the productivity of our fields, securing ever larger harvests able to feed ever greater numbers of people."

 subjugate_baekje_mhn_desc:0 "The rivalry between Baekje and Mokji for rulership of the Mahan Confederacy dates back almost to the founding of Baekje in 18 BC. In order for us to properly centralise Mahan, Baekje must be brought to heel, for as long they maintain independence the rivalry will continue to plague Mahan, while their strength is such that, if theyre humbled, all the other statelets will submit freely."

 riches_of_mahan_mhn_desc:0 "Our confederation is the largest among the Samhan, our splendour is the greatest, our kings are the best known and most respected, our armies are the most formidable, and our people are the wealthiest and best connected to the Han in the north. We must make use of our nations many advantages to build up a treasury able to fund our efforts at home and abroad, thus ensuring that we not only remain the strongest of the Samhan, but that our power continues to grow."
 border_forts_mhn_title:0 "Border Forts"
 border_forts_mhn_desc:0 "The Mahan border is extremely long, with few major geographical features to provide protection, and with enemies on all sides. In order to provide for the security of our people, we should build border forts, able to warn our armies of an enemy incursion and hopefully hold them off long enough for reinforcements to arrive."

 maeu_chungsilhan_mhn_desc:0 "The Han call our people Yong Jian Zhe, or Maeu Chungsilhan in our language, for all of us are willing to die, and fear no enemy. With dramatic changes taking place all over Korea: the Han slowly pushing south; the complete collapse of Gojoseon; and the increasing use of iron and building of walls in our own lands, we should make use of these warriors, raising an army capable of weathering the coming storm."
 king_jun_mhn_title:0 "Avenge King Jun"
 king_jun_mhn_desc:0 "King Jun of Gojoseon was overthrown by Wiman, a military leader from the former kingdom of Yan, which was conquered by the Han. While Wimans kingdom has itself been overthrown, and the area conquered by Han, the Chinese presence in the kingdom once ruled by one of our kings is a sore spot for the nation."
 restore_jin_jin_title:0 "Restore Jin"
 restore_jin_jin_desc:0 "The former Confederation of Jin collapsed centuries ago, leaving behind the confederacies of Mahan, Byeonhan, and Jinhan, each claiming to be its successor. With the Chinese pressing on Korea from the north, the collapse of Wiman Joseon, and rapid changes in society brought by the increase in foreign trade, it is time to reunite Jin under a single banner."
 dongyi_trade_jin_title:0 "Dongyi Trade"
 dongyi_trade_jin_desc:0 "Our state has grown strong on trade, but to truly secure our economy, we must utterly dominate the trade between Korea and Japan and prevent any other nation from replacing us the way that weve replaced many others.

 beijing_trade_jin_title:0 "Beijing Trade"
 beijing_trade_jin_desc:0 "With our grasp over trade at home secure, we should expand into northern China, squeezing our adversaries out of their own home and ensuring that the trade goods that our people have craved for so long can reach our core lands safely. Through economic control of both sides of the Yellow Sea, all the waters around Korea will become our lake, and safe from any would-be attackers."
 hangzhou_trade_jin_title:0 "Hangzhou Trade"
 hangzhou_trade_jin_desc:0 "The Han Dynasty has been dealt a great blow, but they took all of China from a far worse position during the Chu-Han contention. We should not sit idle, for our state will only be truly secure when weve throttled the Han heartland and brought the whole thing entirely under our own control."
 tibet_jin_title:0 "Tibet"
 tibet_jin_desc:0 "The aggressive Tibetan states were a constant thorn in the side of the Han Dynasty, raiding Gansu, the Sichuan Basin, and many other parts of China from their untouchable mountain home. With the collapse of the Han, this is a problem that weve inherited, and one that we ought to bring a decisive end to through the conquest of Tibet, bringing the whole region under our banner."
 canton_trade_jin_title:0 "Canton Trade"
 canton_trade_jin_desc:0 "Southern China is an extremely populous and wealthy region, and up to this point it has resisted complete control. With our hold on the rest of China secure, we should make a renewed effort to increase our control over the regional economy and hence complete our economic and political conquest of China."
 iron_fist_jin_title:0 "Iron Fist of Korea"
 iron_fist_jin_desc:0 "The iron mines of Jin built our state, and while we have grown and changed a great deal since that time, iron remains vital to us, allowing us to make everything from tools to weapons and armour. With an empire like none other in history, our demand for iron has only grown, and to truly supply our state well require every mine we can get our hands on."
 han_vs_han_jin_title:0 "Han Against Han"
 han_vs_han_jin_desc:0 "With the Samhan united once more we should turn our attention to the Chinese in the north of the country. With the fall of Wiman Joseon, the Han set up four Commanderies on its former territory; Lelang, Lintun, Xuantu, and Zhenfan. We should conquer all of them, justifying our expansion as a restoration of Gojoseon under the rule of the many Gojoseon refugees that fled to our lands."
 buyeo_jin_title:0 "Buyeo Kingdom"
 buyeo_jin_desc:0 "The last great Korean kingdom still defending its independence from us, historically Buyeo would fall in 504 under pressure from Baekje and the Xianbei. Buyeo has become a valuable ally for the Chinese as a buffer state against the Xianbei, and their continued independence prevents our nation from expanding further into the mainland. When they fall, however, we shall have formed a true kingdom of the Dongyi, united under a single banner."
 mighty_kingdom_jin_title:0 "Mighty Kingdom"
 mighty_kingdom_jin_desc:0 "It is not enough to unite Korea, we must build the greatest cities that the country has ever seen and expand well beyond the peninsula itself. Where Jin was an insignificant, peripheral nation on the very edge of the Sinosphere, it shall be transformed into the heart of a vast and cosmopolitan empire. The great obstacle in the way of this goal is the Han Dynasty to our west, an adversary that we cannot yet hope to defeat."
 ling_han_ling_jin_jin_title:0 "Ling Han, Ling Jin"
 ling_han_ling_jin_jin_desc:0 "Historically, the Han Dynasty collapsed and was replaced by the Jin Dynasty. Our own people are called both Han and Jin, despite our very different origins. Perhaps its time for one Han to replace another, for one Jin to rise where another shall never be allowed to. The Han have lost heavens favour, where our successes only prove that we have gained it."

 chinese_court_jin_desc:0 "With the Han Dynasty overthrown, and China ruled by a non-Chinese dynasty for the first time in history, our new subjects are asking what now? To lose the Chinese bureaucracy would cripple our ability administer our vast new conquests, yet we cannot retain their loyalty if they see us as Chinese in name only. To prevent our new empire from collapsing beneath us, we should invite some Chinese to our court and administration, and ensure that theyre adequately rewarded for their loyalty to us."

 xiongnu_campaign_jin_desc:0 "Starting with the Battle of Mayi in 133 BC, the Xiongnu and Chinese have been constantly at war. Now that the Chinese are our subjects, bringing a decisive conclusion to this long war is our responsibility. The experience of the Buyeo against the Xianbei and their similar style of warfare will be invaluable in this, as will the liannu crossbow, invented during the Warring States period, and highly effective against the Xiongnu cavalry. The whole Xiongnu empire must be brought to heel so that their raiders can never threaten us again."

 cheonson_jin_desc:0 "Of our nation, people rightly say zhan wu bu sheng, gong wu bu ke. Only one enemy remains to fight: Vietnam. Once it falls, we shall truly be left with no opponents, and the whole world will lie at our feet. Still, we should not underestimate this enemy, the Trung Sisters rebellion wasnt all that long ago, and the difficult terrain of Vietnam has sent many would be conquerors home in defeat."

 tamna_jin_desc:0 "The island of Tamna or Juho has been independent for over 2000 years. It has fairly recently opened up for trade, initially with Mahan, now with Jin as a whole, bringing them the same rapid changes to society that we experienced ourselves not so long ago. Tamna is strategically placed, and their growing dependence on us presents a valuable opportunity for expansion."

 suppress_wokou_jin_desc:0 "Our growing splendour is the envy of the world, and, indeed, it has attracted many pirates to raid our trade routes. Called Wokou, Wako or Waegu, they strike from bases found on the many islets between our lands and the main Wa islands. In order to stop this menace, and prevent the situation from getting worse, we should raid their docks and humiliate their sponsors in Kyushu and Honshu."

 gyuju_jin_desc:0 "The goddess Amaterasu is said to have been born in Himuka, on the island of Gyuju. It was from there, also, that Emperor Jimmu conquered Japan.

 southern_honshu_jin_title:0 "Southern Honshu"
 southern_honshu_jin_desc:0 "Southern Honshu is home to two major kingdoms: Izumo, the land of bronze and silver; and Kibi, a prosperous realm of many temples and shrines. These kingdoms remain largely independent of the Yamato, but theyre powerful in their own right, and if the Yamato are able to centralise the country under their rule, it may become very difficult to dislodge them."
 yamato_jin_title:0 "Yamato"
 yamato_jin_desc:0 "The Yamato are the last obstacle to unification of the Yayoi under our banner, and they should not be underestimated. The Yamato kingdom is already the strongest Yayoi state, and their wealthy lands are defended by mountains. The Yamato Kingdom is largely feudal, with chiefs appointed or recognised by the Tenno. In order to take over the kingdom, all of these chiefs and officials will have to be brought to heel individually."

 emishi_jin_desc:0 "Remnants of the Jomon people, the original inhabitants of Japan, the Emishi are a brave and fierce people who jealously guard their freedom. Historically, they remained a threat until 811, and the last tribes were only brought under imperial control in the 11th century. The Emishi are renowned horse archers and raiders, and will remain a problem for our Japanese holdings until theyre made to submit."
 hokkaido_jin_title:0 "Hokkaido"
 hokkaido_jin_desc:0 "Starting in the Muromachi period, Japan would become progressively more involved with the Ainu as a result of settlements founded by refugees on the Oshima peninsula. We find ourselves in a similar position as our conquered enemies, the Emishi especially, have built up settlements on Hokkaido. The Ainu possess little besides fish and furs, but theyve been adept at bringing us into their own conflicts as we generally support them against the Emishi newcomers. This involvement, and the frequent raids by Emishi on northern Honshu, are quickly becoming more expensive than full occupation would be, and so we should launch a campaign to take the whole island."
 respected_nation_jin_title:0 "Respected Nation"
 respected_nation_jin_desc:0 "While Han records acknowledge the former State of Jin which we now work to restore, it will take a great deal of sustained political effort for our nation to be recognised as their true successors, and still more for our legitimacy as a major regional power to be accepted. We must earn the respect of our neighbours and become a nation which others take seriously, or forever be viewed as mere upstarts in the diplomatic arena."
 king_kings_jin_title:0 "Kings of Kings"
 king_kings_jin_desc:0 "While we are adopting many customs from the Chinese and from other Korean states, the traditional way of ruling for the Jin has always been as kings of kings, heads of great confederations united by personal or tribal loyalty. Perhaps this is not a system which should be discarded lightly, especially as our empire grows and we bring more and more peoples under our banner. Direct rule from the capital is not always practical, and loyal client states can sometimes be more useful than additional citizens."
 shikoku_jin_title:0 "Shikoku"
 shikoku_jin_desc:0 "Named for its four regions, Shikoku is an agricultural island well known for its citrus fruits. It is not a particularly militarily useful place, but it would be wise to conquer it to prevent it from becoming a refuge for those who seek to fight against our rule, and the longer we delay in taking it, the more difficult it will be to prevent attacks on the rest of our Japanese holdings launched from Shikoku."

 temples_jin_desc:0 "We have a vast realm now, peopled with many different cultures and beliefs. Some in our capital are expressing concern that these differing perspectives will tear our new state apart, and that the temples of our gods are being neglected.

 religious_unity_jin_desc:0 "Jin and Wa were once one people, but weve diverged over the ages as the Wa, or Yamato, have adopted many of the beliefs of the Jomon people present in Japan before them.
