Alternatively, Baekje could be approached, and given support against Mokji so that our nations could split Mahan between us.

Each of the original twelve had from 600-5000 families, but those in newly conquered Byeonhan are generally smaller, and none of the statelets except Saro are as developed as we would like.

This system will simply not do with the rapid changes in society, including rapid urbanisation and increased use of iron weapons and armour. It is vital that we create a conscript force, similar to the Chinese, and institute standard training and drill.

From a loose confederation of fifty four different statelets of up to ten thousand families each, we have become a more traditional kingdom divided between just two power centres: Baekje and Mokji. We can try to resist these changes, remaining a tribal confederation and preventing a rift from forming with the northern states around Baekje, however to do so would bring terrible consequences, and likely consign us to a footnote in history."
 phoenicia_east_mhn_title:0 "Phoenicia of the East"
 phoenicia_east_mhn_desc:0 "Historians would come to call Baekje, a member of our confederation, the Phoenicia of East Asia due to its naval prowess. The Mahan coast is long, with many good places for docks and shipyards. So far, however, our naval power is underwhelming. We should make use of our geography and build a true fleet, able to promote our interests along all the points of the compass, and in both Japan and China."
 naval_advisors_mhn_title:0 "Naval Advisors"
 naval_advisors_mhn_desc:0 "Our new fleet is the pride of our nation, but with few experienced sailors and no admirals, it will take considerable investment to convert ships into a true fighting force to project power overseas. To speed the development of the navy, we should seek out experienced naval men, perhaps from China or Japan, who can reform the force."
 animal_husbandry_mhn_title:0 "Animal Husbandry"
 animal_husbandry_mhn_desc:0 "The Sanguo Zhi records that our people have plentiful horses and oxen, but that we do not know how to ride them and that we make use of them only to accompany the dead. We should make efforts to change this by importing larger and stronger horses from the Xianbei in the north and breeding them here for our armies. By breeding only the best oxen generation after generation, we can also greatly increase the productivity of our fields, securing ever larger harvests able to feed ever greater numbers of people."
 subjugate_baekje_mhn_title:0 "Subjugate Baekje"
 subjugate_baekje_mhn_desc:0 "The rivalry between Baekje and Mokji for rulership of the Mahan Confederacy dates back almost to the founding of Baekje in 18 BC. In order for us to properly centralise Mahan, Baekje must be brought to heel, for as long they maintain independence the rivalry will continue to plague Mahan, while their strength is such that, if theyre humbled, all the other statelets will submit freely."
 riches_of_mahan_mhn_title:0 "Riches of Mahan"
 riches_of_mahan_mhn_desc:0 "Our confederation is the largest among the Samhan, our splendour is the greatest, our kings are the best known and most respected, our armies are the most formidable, and our people are the wealthiest and best connected to the Han in the north. We must make use of our nations many advantages to build up a treasury able to fund our efforts at home and abroad, thus ensuring that we not only remain the strongest of the Samhan, but that our power continues to grow."
 border_forts_mhn_title:0 "Border Forts"
 border_forts_mhn_desc:0 "The Mahan border is extremely long, with few major geographical features to provide protection, and with enemies on all sides. In order to provide for the security of our people, we should build border forts, able to warn our armies of an enemy incursion and hopefully hold them off long enough for reinforcements to arrive."
 maeu_chungsilhan_mhn_title:0 "Maeu Chungsilhan"
 maeu_chungsilhan_mhn_desc:0 "The Han call our people Yong Jian Zhe, or Maeu Chungsilhan in our language, for all of us are willing to die, and fear no enemy. With dramatic changes taking place all over Korea: the Han slowly pushing south; the complete collapse of Gojoseon; and the increasing use of iron and building of walls in our own lands, we should make use of these warriors, raising an army capable of weathering the coming storm."
 king_jun_mhn_title:0 "Avenge King Jun"
 king_jun_mhn_desc:0 "King Jun of Gojoseon was overthrown by Wiman, a military leader from the former kingdom of Yan, which was conquered by the Han. While Wimans kingdom has itself been overthrown, and the area conquered by Han, the Chinese presence in the kingdom once ruled by one of our kings is a sore spot for the nation."
 restore_jin_jin_title:0 "Restore Jin"
 restore_jin_jin_desc:0 "The former Confederation of Jin collapsed centuries ago, leaving behind the confederacies of Mahan, Byeonhan, and Jinhan, each claiming to be its successor. With the Chinese pressing on Korea from the north, the collapse of Wiman Joseon, and rapid changes in society brought by the increase in foreign trade, it is time to reunite Jin under a single banner."
 dongyi_trade_jin_title:0 "Dongyi Trade"
 dongyi_trade_jin_desc:0 "Our state has grown strong on trade, but to truly secure our economy, we must utterly dominate the trade between Korea and Japan and prevent any other nation from replacing us the way that weve replaced many others. Only once our control of trade in our home region is complete can we hope to expand beyond it and create an empire where every commodity is found in abundance."
 beijing_trade_jin_title:0 "Beijing Trade"
 beijing_trade_jin_desc:0 "With our grasp over trade at home secure, we should expand into northern China, squeezing our adversaries out of their own home and ensuring that the trade goods that our people have craved for so long can reach our core lands safely. Through economic control of both sides of the Yellow Sea, all the waters around Korea will become our lake, and safe from any would-be attackers."
 hangzhou_trade_jin_title:0 "Hangzhou Trade"
 hangzhou_trade_jin_desc:0 "The Han Dynasty has been dealt a great blow, but they took all of China from a far worse position during the Chu-Han contention. We should not sit idle, for our state will only be truly secure when weve throttled the Han heartland and brought the whole thing entirely under our own control."
 tibet_jin_title:0 "Tibet"
 tibet_jin_desc:0 "The aggressive Tibetan states were a constant thorn in the side of the Han Dynasty, raiding Gansu, the Sichuan Basin, and many other parts of China from their untouchable mountain home. With the collapse of the Han, this is a problem that weve inherited, and one that we ought to bring a decisive end to through the conquest of Tibet, bringing the whole region under our banner."
 canton_trade_jin_title:0 "Canton Trade"
 canton_trade_jin_desc:0 "Southern China is an extremely populous and wealthy region, and up to this point it has resisted complete control. With our hold on the rest of China secure, we should make a renewed effort to increase our control over the regional economy and hence complete our economic and political conquest of China."
 iron_fist_jin_title:0 "Iron Fist of Korea"
 iron_fist_jin_desc:0 "The iron mines of Jin built our state, and while we have grown and changed a great deal since that time, iron remains vital to us, allowing us to make everything from tools to weapons and armour. With an empire like none other in history, our demand for iron has only grown, and to truly supply our state well require every mine we can get our hands on."
 han_vs_han_jin_title:0 "Han Against Han"
 han_vs_han_jin_desc:0 "With the Samhan united once more we should turn our attention to the Chinese in the north of the country. With the fall of Wiman Joseon, the Han set up four Commanderies on its former territory; Lelang, Lintun, Xuantu, and Zhenfan. We should conquer all of them, justifying our expansion as a restoration of Gojoseon under the rule of the many Gojoseon refugees that fled to our lands."
 buyeo_jin_title:0 "Buyeo Kingdom"
 buyeo_jin_desc:0 "The last great Korean kingdom still defending its independence from us, historically Buyeo would fall in 504 under pressure from Baekje and the Xianbei. Buyeo has become a valuable ally for the Chinese as a buffer state against the Xianbei, and their continued independence prevents our nation from expanding further into the mainland. When they fall, however, we shall have formed a true kingdom of the Dongyi, united under a single banner."
 mighty_kingdom_jin_title:0 "Mighty Kingdom"
 mighty_kingdom_jin_desc:0 "It is not enough to unite Korea, we must build the greatest cities that the country has ever seen and expand well beyond the peninsula itself. Where Jin was an insignificant, peripheral nation on the very edge of the Sinosphere, it shall be transformed into the heart of a vast and cosmopolitan empire. The great obstacle in the way of this goal is the Han Dynasty to our west, an adversary that we cannot yet hope to defeat."
 ling_han_ling_jin_jin_title:0 "Ling Han, Ling Jin"
 ling_han_ling_jin_jin_desc:0 "Historically, the Han Dynasty collapsed and was replaced by the Jin Dynasty. Our own people are called both Han and Jin, despite our very different origins. Perhaps its time for one Han to replace another, for one Jin to rise where another shall never be allowed to. The Han have lost heavens favour, where our successes only prove that we have gained it."
 chinese_court_jin_title:0 "Chinese Court"
 chinese_court_jin_desc:0 "With the Han Dynasty overthrown, and China ruled by a non-Chinese dynasty for the first time in history, our new subjects are asking what now? To lose the Chinese bureaucracy would cripple our ability administer our vast new conquests, yet we cannot retain their loyalty if they see us as Chinese in name only. To prevent our new empire from collapsing beneath us, we should invite some Chinese to our court and administration, and ensure that theyre adequately rewarded for their loyalty to us."
 xiongnu_campaign_jin_title:0 "Xiongnu Campaign"
 xiongnu_campaign_jin_desc:0 "Starting with the Battle of Mayi in 133 BC, the Xiongnu and Chinese have been constantly at war. Now that the Chinese are our subjects, bringing a decisive conclusion to this long war is our responsibility. The experience of the Buyeo against the Xianbei and their similar style of warfare will be invaluable in this, as will the liannu crossbow, invented during the Warring States period, and highly effective against the Xiongnu cavalry. The whole Xiongnu empire must be brought to heel so that their raiders can never threaten us again."
 cheonson_jin_title:0 "Cheonson"
 cheonson_jin_desc:0 "Of our nation, people rightly say zhan wu bu sheng, gong wu bu ke. Only one enemy remains to fight: Vietnam. Once it falls, we shall truly be left with no opponents, and the whole world will lie at our feet. Still, we should not underestimate this enemy, the Trung Sisters rebellion wasnt all that long ago, and the difficult terrain of Vietnam has sent many would be conquerors home in defeat."
 tamna_jin_title:0 "Tamna"
 tamna_jin_desc:0 "The island of Tamna or Juho has been independent for over 2000 years. It has fairly recently opened up for trade, initially with Mahan, now with Jin as a whole, bringing them the same rapid changes to society that we experienced ourselves not so long ago. Tamna is strategically placed, and their growing dependence on us presents a valuable opportunity for expansion."
 suppress_wokou_jin_title:0 "Suppress the Wokou"
 suppress_wokou_jin_desc:0 "Our growing splendour is the envy of the world, and, indeed, it has attracted many pirates to raid our trade routes. Called Wokou, Wako or Waegu, they strike from bases found on the many islets between our lands and the main Wa islands. In order to stop this menace, and prevent the situation from getting worse, we should raid their docks and humiliate their sponsors in Kyushu and Honshu."
 gyuju_jin_title:0 "Gyuju"
 gyuju_jin_desc:0 "The goddess Amaterasu is said to have been born in Himuka, on the island of Gyuju. It was from there, also, that Emperor Jimmu conquered Japan. Both for this reason, and because Gyuju is simply the closest Japanese island to us, we should start our invasion of the Japanese islands there."
 southern_honshu_jin_title:0 "Southern Honshu"
 southern_honshu_jin_desc:0 "Southern Honshu is home to two major kingdoms: Izumo, the land of bronze and silver; and Kibi, a prosperous realm of many temples and shrines. These kingdoms remain largely independent of the Yamato, but theyre powerful in their own right, and if the Yamato are able to centralise the country under their rule, it may become very difficult to dislodge them."
 yamato_jin_title:0 "Yamato"
 yamato_jin_desc:0 "The Yamato are the last obstacle to unification of the Yayoi under our banner, and they should not be underestimated. The Yamato kingdom is already the strongest Yayoi state, and their wealthy lands are defended by mountains. The Yamato Kingdom is largely feudal, with chiefs appointed or recognised by the Tenno. In order to take over the kingdom, all of these chiefs and officials will have to be brought to heel individually."
 emishi_jin_title:0 "Emishi"
 emishi_jin_desc:0 "Remnants of the Jomon people, the original inhabitants of Japan, the Emishi are a brave and fierce people who jealously guard their freedom. Historically, they remained a threat until 811, and the last tribes were only brought under imperial control in the 11th century. The Emishi are renowned horse archers and raiders, and will remain a problem for our Japanese holdings until theyre made to submit."
 hokkaido_jin_title:0 "Hokkaido"
 hokkaido_jin_desc:0 "Starting in the Muromachi period, Japan would become progressively more involved with the Ainu as a result of settlements founded by refugees on the Oshima peninsula. We find ourselves in a similar position as our conquered enemies, the Emishi especially, have built up settlements on Hokkaido. The Ainu possess little besides fish and furs, but theyve been adept at bringing us into their own conflicts as we generally support them against the Emishi newcomers. This involvement, and the frequent raids by Emishi on northern Honshu, are quickly becoming more expensive than full occupation would be, and so we should launch a campaign to take the whole island."
 respected_nation_jin_title:0 "Respected Nation"
 respected_nation_jin_desc:0 "While Han records acknowledge the former State of Jin which we now work to restore, it will take a great deal of sustained political effort for our nation to be recognised as their true successors, and still more for our legitimacy as a major regional power to be accepted. We must earn the respect of our neighbours and become a nation which others take seriously, or forever be viewed as mere upstarts in the diplomatic arena."
 king_kings_jin_title:0 "Kings of Kings"
 king_kings_jin_desc:0 "While we are adopting many customs from the Chinese and from other Korean states, the traditional way of ruling for the Jin has always been as kings of kings, heads of great confederations united by personal or tribal loyalty. Perhaps this is not a system which should be discarded lightly, especially as our empire grows and we bring more and more peoples under our banner. Direct rule from the capital is not always practical, and loyal client states can sometimes be more useful than additional citizens."
 shikoku_jin_title:0 "Shikoku"
 shikoku_jin_desc:0 "Named for its four regions, Shikoku is an agricultural island well known for its citrus fruits. It is not a particularly militarily useful place, but it would be wise to conquer it to prevent it from becoming a refuge for those who seek to fight against our rule, and the longer we delay in taking it, the more difficult it will be to prevent attacks on the rest of our Japanese holdings launched from Shikoku."
 temples_jin_title:0 "Temples"
 temples_jin_desc:0 "We have a vast realm now, peopled with many different cultures and beliefs. Some in our capital are expressing concern that these differing perspectives will tear our new state apart, and that the temples of our gods are being neglected. To silence their complaints, and to impose some measure of conformity, we should make an effort to build temples to our gods throughout the lands weve conquered."
 religious_unity_jin_title:0 "Religious Unity"
 religious_unity_jin_desc:0 "Jin and Wa were once one people, but weve diverged over the ages as the Wa, or Yamato, have adopted many of the beliefs of the Jomon people present in Japan before them. With our control over the Japanese islands growing we must re-establish a unified religious identity for our peoples."
 bongjeongsa_jin_title:0 "Bongjeongsa"
 bongjeongsa_jin_desc:0 "Bongjeongsa is a temple, historically established in 672, in Andong. A vast site, its also the oldest wooden structure in Korea. With a strong religious identity established for our people, together with a mighty and growing empire, we should develop our capital and start work on a great temple to showcase our power and influence to the world."
