With this, the Umayyad Caliphate ended and the Abbasid Caliphate began. Across the next few centuries, the Abbasid Caliphate would make room for Islam's Golden Age, developing literature, math, and science greatly. Baghdad would become the center of the world and continue to be a marvel of its time until the sacking of it by the Mongols in the mid 13th century. Although Arabic continued to be the main language of government, many local provinces had cultural and religious freedom, decreasin unrest throughout the empire.

He had been on the run for six years after the Umayyads had lost the position of caliph in Damascus in 750 to the Abbasid usurper. Intent on regaining a position of power, he defeated the existing Islamic rulers of the area who had defied Umayyad rule and united various local fiefdoms into an emirate."

 dynasties.22.d:0 "The Umayyads are the descendent of Umayya ibn Abd Shams, a distant relative of Muhammad. Ruqqayah, daughter of Muhammad, married the third Rashidun Caliph, Uthman ibn Affan, whose great grandfather was Umayyad ibn Abd Shams. The Umayyads rose to power following the First Fitna in which the Rashidun Caliphate crumbled and the Umayyad Caliphate was born. The Umayyads held power from 661 to 750, but controlled the Iberian penninsula until 1031.

Finally, in 777 Abd ar-Rahmn ibn Rustam, who was one of the four original missionaries, was elected Imam. Unlike other Ibadi Imamets, this Imamete was hereditary.
