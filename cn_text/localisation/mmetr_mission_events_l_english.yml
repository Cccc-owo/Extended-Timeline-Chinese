Now, our Shahanshah has conquered Turan, accomplishing what our Iranian forefathers of the first Iranian dynasty of the Pishdadians had thousands of years ago.

Thus, we have instead built up two more fire temples of our own to eclipse the fame of the Parthian flame: one in Azar Goshnasp in Media, and one in Azar Farnbag in our homeland of Fars.\n\nWe have also associated each of these Three Great Fires with a certain aspect of society: Azar Goshnasp is associated with warriors; Azar Farnbag is associated with the magi priests; lastly, and certainly least, is the Parthian fire of Azar Barzin, which we have associated with the absolute lowest estate, the farmers and herdsmen.

As our soldiers poured into the Eternal City in search of plunder, they saw before them the head religious leader of Rome, who presents us an offer. The bishop offers to allow our Vandal forces to continually plunder the city for several days without resistance, as long as we do not lay waste to the city of Rome or slaughter its inhabitants. Although we clearly possess more bargaining power in this situation, perhaps we should act as peaceful plunderers if it means we can resume our plunder without resistance. Of course, even if we do take the offer, no one will be able to stop us if we decide to take several Romans back as slaves."

Thus, our soldiers carried on with looting the great riches of the Eternal City, as well as captured several unfortunate Romans as slaves. Our soldiers spent many days in Rome plundering the city thoroughly, even taking prizes from the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus itself. By accepting their deal, it seems that we Vandals were given more time to meticulously plunder from every corner of the city without any pressure of having to retreat from the city."

The pathetic Romans could only look on in horror as we pillaged their great Eternal City as if it were just another common town ripe for plunder. Although accepting the bishop's offer would have given us more time to thoroughly plunder the city without the pressure of having to retreat from the city, the amount of destruction and devastation we have brought upon the Romans' home city more than makes up for the shorter duration of plundering."

Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] could tell from their first conversation that the man was a great asset and could potentially lead our armies to glory and victory against our rivals.

With their subjugation, there is no better way for the Huns to repay us than with their lives on the battlefield. Despite the vile horrors they have brought upon us, it would be foolish if we did not attempt to utilize their natural skill on horseback for our own gain.

 mmetr_ROW_mission_events.2.desc: "The legions of Rome were once the unstoppable fighting force of the Mediterranean, and all rivals of Rome were crushed by our forefathers. Generations later, the legions became a symbol of Roman decay, with the desperate empire recruiting from Romans and barbarians alike just to keep the fragile realm together. In times of civil war, legions even declared their own generals emperors, and they declared emperors traitors.\n\nThanks to our efforts to rejuvenate the Roman military and regain the legacy of our forefathers, however, we have turned things around. Being more strict with our recruitment and training as well as ensuring our legions' blades remain honed through continued glory and distinctions on the battlefield, we have created a Roman army that is at last worthy of our forefathers of Rome."

With many of our laws dating back to the times of Augustus and even the Roman Republic, we would benefit greatly from a clear set of codified laws.\n\nAt the same time, we now have the option for reform. Do we wish to allow our non-Roman subjects to have their own local, cultural laws as long as they roughly align with our own ideals, or shall we enforce Roman laws and customs upon our all of subjects, no matter how far away from Rome they may be?"

 mmetr_ROW_mission_events.5.desc: "Thanks the the efforts of devout bishops across the empire, we have succeeded in spreading the word of God to the farthest reaches of the Roman Empire. By heeding the advice of these wise bishops, we have achieved greater prosperity and piety in our realm. Many talents such as those of Augustine of Hippo, a bishop in Africa of Berber origin, have allowed us to combat heresies in lands far from our capital in $CAPITAL_CITY$."

 mmetr_ROW_mission_events.6.desc: "At the Battle of Teutoburg Forest, the Germanic barbarians ambushed our Roman legions, annihilating three Roman legions and stealing three eagle standards from the fallen legions. Although the three eagle standards lost at the disastrous Battle of Teutoburg had already been recovered long ago, the humiliation of such a defeat continues to be a rallying point for the Germans, and the legions themselves that fell in battle that day could never be recovered. Additionally, while Rome under Augustus and his successors retaliated against the Germans and saw success, we never truly established a permanent Roman presence in the lands of Germania, unlike the richer provinces of Gallia and Hispania. Through acquiring significant, permanent gains in the heartlands of Germania, however, we have recovered our pride and reinvigorated the Roman war machine. Though Germania in the past was a land that was of no use to us, the Germanic threat that continues today has shown us that the Germanic threat must be vanquished thoroughly!"

Separated from mainland Europe by a channel, the lands of Britannia are among our least prioritized domains, especially as we continue to face threats from the east as well as from within. Thus, the limitanei of Britannia are more isolated than ever, yet they still continue to stand guard against barbarian threats to the north and west, steadfast and battle-ready along the newly-fortified defenses of Hadrian's Wall in the far north."

 mmetr_ROW_mission_events.8.t: "Romano-Briton Culture"
 mmetr_ROW_mission_events.8.desc: "The integration of many peoples in the land of Britannia has resulted in the birth of a distinctly Romano-Briton culture, a hybrid of the Celtic Briton and Latin Roman cultures in a land far from the city of Rome itself. Though they possess many traditions that are quite different from the Romans of Italia, their assimilation of key Roman culture, ideals and ways of life has made them perhaps even closer to us Romans than even their Briton and Celtic cousins."

Uniting the Eternal City with the city of Constantine once more, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has become known as a great unifier. To avoid any further disunity, there are many in the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s circle who propose that we make clear the historical, symbolic and political superiority of the old capital of Rome over the eastern capital of Konstantinoupolis. Thus, there are some who propose that we remove all traces of the Greek name Konstantinoupolis and instead maintain the name of 'Nova Roma' for the eastern capital, ensuring that the Latin name of Roma shall be heard and spoken by all of our new subjects in the east."

With the Roman Empire, it became standard for the ruler of the empire to be granted the title of 'imperator' regardless of their achievements. With the recent victories in the lands of the Greeks, our Imperator [Root.Monarch.GetName] invokes the glorious martial image of the imperators of old as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] parades through both Rome and Constantinople, a clear display of the martial might of Rome and the triumph of the West over the pretender forces of the East."

 mmetr_ROW_mission_events.11.desc: "For many generations, we Romans have ventured far into the lands of Germania only to turn back after having deemed the lands lacking. However, these lands of Germania are home to many adversaries of the Roman Empire who continue to defy Roman hegemony to this day. Thus, our armies have successfully marched in the lands of Magna Germania, claimed its territories and subjugated its peoples as fully-integrated subjects of the empire. Even now, there are many of Germanic descent who hold prominent positions in our empire, just as the early empire had led to emperors from Egypt, Syria and Hispania. Thus, even when critics deemed us to be a declining empire we continue to expand our borders and have now established a new province of Magna Germania."

 mmetr_LON_mission_events.2.desc: "Santiago, also known as Saint James, was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus and is especially renowned in the lands of Galicia. It is believed by many that his remains were found in Compostela, proof that the great Santiago was buried in our own very lands. This has led to increased pilgrimage to Compostela, so much so that the route of pilgrimage has earned a name: Camino de Santiago. Additionally, it is believed that the great Santiago miraculously appeared at the Battle of Clavijo to lead the Christian warriors of Asturias to victory against the Moors, leading to the creation of a prominent cult of worship as well as the nickname Santiago Matamoros, or Saint James the 'Moor-Slayer.'\n\nThanks to his legendary status in Hispanic Christianity, we have worked hard to protect the pilgrims and foster a safe haven in Compostela in his honor. Additionally, with the newly-expanded city of Compostela, we now have the option to move our regional capital in Galicia to Compostela."

Thus, we have proven ourselves the undisputed and glorious heirs of the Asturian throne.\n\nAs the successors of Asturias, we have also inherited a great artifact. The Cruz de la Victoria, the 'Cross of Victory,' is a splendid jeweled cross from the age of the Asturian kinship. According to legend, the cross was carried by Pelagius of Asturias in battle against the Moors at Covadonga, the battle and first Asturian victory that marked the beginning of the Reconquista.

While the Muslim Moors were our enemies in our wars for the Reconquista, their talent in cultivating a fine and sophisticated capital is a fact that cannot be denied. Thus, with many of the non-Christian administrators, advisors and scholars still in Córdoba, which includes both Muslim and Jewish talents alike, we are now faced with the question on how to handle these new non-Christian talents."

The Uji are thus very influential in the realms of politics, economics and even religion. By heeding the advice of these clans and successfully carrying out their requests, we have earned the respect and loyalty of even the most influential clan members who were previously difficult to rein in.

Several members of the court have already converted, and many of our diplomats sent overseas have also converted to the Mahayana sect of Buddhism. On the local level, the teachings of the Buddha have been incorporated into Shinto beliefs, which means that instating Buddhism as a state religion would likely result in a rather smooth transition for our peoples, as the Shinto deities would not be set aside but instead incorporated into a Shinto-Buddhist faith."

Such a skilled maneuver requires absolute mastery of horsemanship. This tactic was made famous by the Parthian annihilation of the Roman armies of Crassus. When the Roman general Marcus Antonius returned to Parthia to avenge Crassus' humiliating defeat, our Parthian light cavalry devastated the Roman ranks once more - the Roman campaign was a disaster, and we Parthians sent them running back to Rome.\n\nSince then, our light cavalry have trained hard day and night to master the use of the Parthian shot in all types of terrains and weather conditions.

Great Parthian rulers and generals such as Mithridates the Great conquered the lands and satraps of the Seleukids, including the domains of Persia, Media and Babylonia, expanding the Parthian realm from a revolter kingdom to an empire rivaling that of the Greeks and Romans. However, we never truly had the opportunity to finish what we started, as the Romans subjugated the Seleukid heartland of Syria before we could do so.

Additionally, the Zoroastrian priests continue to kindle the fires of Cappadocia, and many Cappadocians still remain pious to this shared faith of ours.

With the lands of Pontus freed from the Roman yoke, we now have the option of establishing a new client kingdom of Pontus that shall be loyal to the Parthian throne. We Parthians have always opted for client kingdoms rather than direct rule when direct rule is not necessary, such as in the cases of Persis, Characene and Elymais. Thus, shall we continue the legacy of Mithridates by fostering anti-Roman sentiments in Pontus once more?"

Through our efforts of consolidating our homeland and securing our borders, we have proven ourselves capable overlords, attracting the submission of various former Dahae tribes to the north.

Meroe is home to many treasures dating back multiple centuries, and most of the denizens of the city have already accepted whatever fate may befall them.

Known in the local Ethiopian language of Ge'ez as 'Tewahedo', meaning 'united as one,' a new belief among our peoples argues that there is a perfect union of the divine and human natures of Christ, rather than the belief in Rome and Greece that Christ possesses two natures, divine and human.

The most prominent of these is Ashoka the Great of Maurya, the first emperor to convert to Buddhism and one who sponsored the spread of Buddhism far and wide, sending missionaries westward beyond the Indus and as far south as Anuradhapura in the island of Lanka.\n\nThus, in emulation of these great emperors, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has officially adopted the regnal title 'Devaputra-Shao-Shaonanoshao,' meaning 'Son of God, King, King of Kings,' making our divine right to rule clear to all of our subjects as we continue to uphold the tenets and teachings of the true faith in our imperial realm."

The Satavahana king Satakarni had adopted a title relating to this region himself, naming himself 'Lord of Dakshinapatha, wielder of the unchecked wheel of Sovereignty.' Having completely defeated the Satavahana and conquered the lands of the Deccan and the southern road, we have therefore inherited this prestigious title as we now control both the northern and southern highways, the Uttarapatha and Dakshinapatha."

Since the fall of the Mauryan Empire, the artists of Mathura have employed a distinct style unique to Mathura that is in high demand for export to cities and peoples all across India. Furthermore, it is said that the very first artistic representation of the Lord Buddha, the Isapur Buddha, was produced in Mathura.

However, as the successors of the Mauryan as the new indisputed hegemons of both northern and southern India, including the Uttarapatha and Dakshinapatha, we Kushans had finished when the Mauryans had started, uniting all of the lands of Tamilakam under our domains in southern India. However, the lands of the Tamil are far from our base of operations, and its peoples are accustomed with autonomy rather than being subject to other powers. Thus, perhaps to accomodate them, we could establish a new client king of Tamilakam who shall remain loyal to us while also granting us access to the spice trade of the southern coasts."

[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetName] was so impressed with these foreign musicians that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has founded an institute for Funanese music near our capital city of $CAPITAL_CITY$, where Chinese musicians can study the musical styles of Funan."

This dynasty is also known as the Naga dynasty, as the family of Queen Soma prior to her rule was known as the Naga family, named after powerful and divine serpents known as Naga.\n\nThus, just like the Lunar and Solar dynasties of the great Indian epic the Mahabharata, we people of Funan too have our own legendary royal family under which we can rally.

Once unrivaled in the region, the Cham navies were especially skilled in naval warfare tactics such as conducting raids and blockades, boarding enemy ships, and even carrying out stealth tactics from the water. Thus, the ships, warriors and expertise of our former enemies of Champa shall be especially useful for achieving our maritime ambitions beyond the shores of Funan."

Besides our own mountain, we have ventured further inland along the Mekong River and subjugated various other mountains and cities across the lands of the Khmer peoples. However, our kingdom has always been a maritime polity, based around thriving port cities and overseas trade. Thus, in answering the question of governing peoples farther inland from the Mekong Delta, we may be better off granting autonomy to the inland peoples and creating loyal vassals who shall rule on the behalf of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] as well as provide tribute and soldiers to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."

Furthermore, with the urban expansion and recent population boom of this capital city, we have acquired not only prestige but also a developed center of power from which we can directly administer the surrounding lands with greater efficiently, as opposed to relying on loyal but autonomous cities and local tributaries."

While the Brahmins are by definition the priestly caste of society, their knowledge does not consist of only religious matters. Instead, the Brahmins are talented scholars well-versed in many different fields, studying statecraft, mathematics, science, philosophy, economics and literature. Thus, an individual Brahmin may be able to fill a variety of roles in our administration - thus, let us employ them in whatever focus is needed at the moment."

While we now rule over Buddhist subjects, a difference in faith does not necessarily guarantee religious conflict. The Buddhists in India have usually coexisted peacefully under Hindu rulers, and the Buddhist and Hindu faiths have several similarities and shared values. Religious authorities from both Hinduism and Buddhism have understood the other religion as merely a different way of viewing the same illusionary world. Thus, let us assure our new subjects that we shall not persecute them for their beliefs, and no harm shall be brought upon them as long as they remain loyal to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."

Having established a great kingdom of Funan stretching from the Mekong Delta to the Kra Isthmus, [Root.Monarch.Title] [Root.Monarch.GetName] is now known to all as 'Great King of Funan' in both Sanskrit as well as a variety of foreign tongues across the world. As the undisputed ruler of many, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has obtained the absolute loyalty of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] subjects and people.\n\nWith a great kingdom established along the gulf, we can now turn our attention further south to pursue greater ambitions. Although we have established a monopoly over the lucrative trade routes along the isthmus, the Malay states and their strait to the south have recently become a major trade rival to our own ports.

Now that we have expanded our direct influence over all of the southern Malay peninsula, we have been reunited with these cousins of ours in the south. As it can be difficult to directly rule over these lands across the sea from Vyadhapura, we could establish an autonomous vassal of Chi Tu ruled by a member of our own royal dynasty."

Furthermore, we have also benefited from exchanging embassies and gifts with the Kings of Vanga.\n\nNow, we have expanded into the realm of India itself, placing the lords of Vanga and their Indian subjects under our protection.

Now that we have established our own great empire stretching from the fertile grounds of the Mekong River Delta all the way to the thriving port cities of Vanga, it is only fitting that our ruler [Root.Monarch.GetName] has officially adopted the prestigious title of 'Maharajadhiraja', a Sanskrit title meaning 'Great King of Kings,' one step in status above the previous title of 'Great King of Funan.' As the emperor of a new Funanese empire, we shall continue dreaming of greater ambitions until we become the Chakravartin, the sacred 'Wheel-Turning King' in Hinduism who shall be the universal ruler of all four continents in the world!"

This is especially important for realizing our future ambitions in the Middle Kingdom, as the cities of China are larger and more heavily fortified than what we have encountered in our home region.

Thus, one of the naval captains serving under our great [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has discovered an island in the southern waters of the Bay of Bengal that can serve as a valuable naval base from which we can launch naval invasions and raids along the Indian coastline.

Having expressed thanks to the Indian ambassador, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has declared that the horses be given the best care possible in the royal stables.

Despite facing a much more powerful army, our forces were able to inflict several significant defeats upon the invading Roman armies. Even so, many of our cities including our own capital were sacked by the Romans, and much of our attention since then has been focused on rebuilding. While we had made peace with the Romans with terms favorable to us, our Queen Amanirenas made sure the Romans knew disrupting the peace would result in our wrath, sending an envoy to the Romans with a bundle of golden arrows along with the message: 'If you want peace, they are a token of her warmth and friendship. If you want war, you will need them.'\n\nThus, as we now wage war with the Romans, our victories on the battlefield have rallied our men to the cause as well as earned the respect of foreign polities across the land who were otherwise threatened by Roman armies.

However, through the wise rule of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] we have restored the capital city of Meroë to its former glory. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has restored the Temple of Amun in Meroë as well as constructed numerous reservoirs for storing water.

The kings of Kush even had to travel from Meroë to Napata upon their coronation to receive the crown from the Temple of Amun. This dynamic changed, however, when the royal family of Kush defied the powerful priests of Napata and massacred them. The burial of kings was moved to Meroë, and the situation in Napata grew even more dire during our war with the Romans, as the city was razed to the ground by the Romans.\n\nAs the city continues to be a religious center for the worship of the primary god Amun, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has made great efforts to restore the holy city and expand the Temple of Amun in Napata.

In recent generations, our royal dynasty of Kush had contended with the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt and the Roman Empire for influence over the lands of the First Cataract of the Nile River: When the Hellenistic Ptolemies ruled Egypt, the region revolted against them under the Egyptian rebel Horwennefer - though Horwennefer swore allegiance to Kush, his rebellion was eventually quashed by the Ptolemies. Two centuries later, our Queen Amanirenas led a campaign against Rome and temporarily seized the city of Aswan - while the war was ultimately inconclusive, the terms of peace were favorable to us, and the city of Aswan was placed under our authority.\n\nNow, boldened by the martial might of our own warriors and having seen the decline of the Roman Empire, we have valiantly marched even further north along the Nile, beyond the limits of the First Cataract, and now possess a gateway into the rest of Loewr Egypt.

An achievement not seen since our forefathers conquered Lower Egypt and established the Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt many centuries ago, the conquest of the Nile has brought not only prosperity and riches to our kingdom but also new peoples and talents into our state. However, simply conquering land is not enough for us to become a empire in our own right, especially during the age of empires such as those of the Romans and Persians. While there is still much work left to be done, our armies and peoples can finally rejoice at the unification of the Nile under [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]!"

An influential priestly caste runs the Temple of Philae as well as the surrounding regions, and both Ptolemaic Greek and Egyptian rulers in the past have made pilgrimages to the sacred Temple of Philae in the past.\n\nWith the restoration of the Temples of the Dodekaschoinos, the local priestly elite of the region has also thrived. The most notable of these is the Nubian priestly Wayekiye family. Furthermore, members of the Wayekiye family have entered our own court in Meroë swearing their allegiance - thus, our friendship with the Wayekiye shall allow us to use the Wayekiye family as an agent through which we can exert greater influence over the land and peoples of Dodekaschoinos, a region still contested between Rome and Meroë."

Although Egypt had changed hands from the Greek Ptolemies to the Romans, unlike the Greeks the Roman Empire never claimed to be an official dynasty of Egypt. While the Roman emperors still sponsored and made offerings at the Egyptian temples, the sacred lands of Egypt were largely taken for granted and only made a province of the Roman Empire.\n\nWith the full annexation of Egypt, from the waters of the Nile to the Red Sea coast to the cities of Cyrenaica, we are the first Kushite dynasty since the Twenty-fifth Dynasty to rule Egypt. Thus, we have officially declared our [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] dynasty as the Thirty-third Dynasty of Egypt, the successors to a long line of rulers spanning over three millenia of human history. Though we have inherited by legacy, how we shall practically rule over the realm - and how much of the image and culture of the Egyptian pharaoh we wish to adopt - still remains undecided."

Most recently, there has been a dispute over the trade and possession of the ivory in the region.

Divers from our ships swam towards the enemy fleet and fastened ropes to the rudders of the Byzantine ships, and earthenware pots filled with Greek fire were then rolled along these ropes to collide with the Byzantine vessels, destroying many of their ships and resulting in a major victory for our forces.

 mmetr_NAN_mission_events.2.t: "Imperial Capital of Tibet"
 mmetr_NAN_mission_events.2.desc: "After a hard-won siege, we have finally earned the capitulation of Lhasa, the former capital city of the Tibetan Empire. With the former capital of the Tibetan people now under our control, we can now consider the permanent presence that we wish to establish in the lands of Tibet.\n\nThus, let us first set an example of how we shall rule the lands for posterity - shall we be benevolent rulers who shall mostly leave the Tibetans to local chiefly rule, or shall we integrate the land and people into our growing kingdom through whatever means necessary?"
 mmetr_NAN_mission_events.2.a: "We shall leave the existing administration intact."
 mmetr_NAN_mission_events.2.b: "We must do what we must to integrate them into our own administrative system."
 mmetr_NAN_mission_events.3.t: "An Empire in Tibet"
 mmetr_NAN_mission_events.3.desc: "The Zhao were once subjects of the Tibetan Empire many years ago. Today, we have turned the tables on them, as now all of the lands of the former empire and its peoples are under the direct control of our state. With these territorial gains, we have hundreds of thousands of new subjects under our banner. Let us continue to expand our administration and establish a regional empire much like the Tibetans once ruled during the times of our forefathers."
 mmetr_NAN_mission_events.3.a: "Glory to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], conqueror of the Tibetans!"
 mmetr_NAN_mission_events.4.t: "The Cities of the Pyu"
 mmetr_NAN_mission_events.4.desc: "The city states that were once ruled by the peoples of Pyu peoples to the south have finally all fallen to the might of our armies. Though their kings had challenged our authority, we have proven to all of their peoples that we are not to be defied. Having fully consolidated our position in the region of Miandian to the south, we have gained the fealty of the various cities that once thrived just south of our homeland. With so many cities now under our control, we have expanded our methods of extracting tribute and soldiers across a greater expanse of land.\n\nWhile the peoples of these city-states now serve under the common banner of the Zhao, we also all follow the teachings of Lord Buddha. Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and the kingdoms of Miandian have long shared religious ties in our devotion to the Dharma. Thus, we can send missionaries to the south to spread the teachings of our specific doctrine among the Buddhists of the far south."
 mmetr_NAN_mission_events.4.a: "The cities of the south shall all come to know the Zhao as their suzerains!"
 mmetr_NAN_mission_events.5.t: "Chakravartin of Angkor"
 mmetr_NAN_mission_events.5.desc: "The lands of the Khmer is home to a great empire in the south, with a mighty army of war elephants unrivaled by its regional rivals. Their ruler, seated in the Khmer capital of Angkor and holding the title of Chakravartin, has surrendered to us after a glorious campaign far from our home in Yunnan.\n\nWith the conquest of Angkor and its imperial territories, we have inherited the prestigious title of Chakravartin, or 'Wheel-Turning King,' the sacred king who rules over the universe. This title is known as Zhuanlunwang in the tongue of the Chinese - thus, we have officially made the declaration of adopting this title, a move that has spread our fame and prestige far and wide across both Chinese and Indianized realms alike."
 mmetr_NAN_mission_events.5.a: "May the Heavens bless the Wheel-Turning King of Zhao!"
 mmetr_NAN_mission_events.6.t: "Legacy of the Cuan Clan"
 mmetr_NAN_mission_events.6.desc: "The forefathers of we Mywa people were the Cuan clan, a prominent family who lived in the lands of Yunnan and rose to prominence under the Shu Han dynasty of Chengdu. Following the Southern Campaigns of the famed Zhuge Liang of Shu Han, our ancestors of the Cuan family rose to prominence as local administrators and nobility on behalf of the imperial family of Shu Han. However, the Cuan were defeated by the Sui dynasty and split into the White Mywa and Black Mywa who govern our state today.\n\nAlthough it has been many centuries and generations since the times of the Cuan clan, we have successfully upheld the prestigious legacy of our ancestors by capturing the city of Chengdu, the major stronghold of Jiannan under the Tang as well as the former capital of the Shu Han dynasty that our Cuan ancestors had served. Chengdu has served as the capital of many emperors and kings in history - thus, perhaps it would be wise for us to relocated our capital to Chengdu, from which we can more easily administer our new domains in Jiannan. Doing so shall also allow us to smoothly integrate the existing administrative structure of the region."
 mmetr_NAN_mission_events.6.a: "Move our royal seat to former capital of Shu Han."
 mmetr_NAN_mission_events.6.b: "Import the administrators of Chengdu to our own capital instead."
 mmetr_NAN_mission_events.7.t: "Rulers of Chang'an"
 mmetr_NAN_mission_events.7.desc: "The Tang capital of Chang'an has finally fallen to our forces after a hard-won siege that shall go down into the annals of history as one of the Zhao's greatest watershed moments. When we Black and White Mywa of the southern Zhao states initially united, our forefathers could only dream of ruling an autonomous kingdom powerful enough to fend off its neighbors, the powerful Tang and Tibetan Empires. However, we have now achieved such strength, and gained such favor from Heaven, that our forces have even vanquished these powerful forces while on the offensive, seizing the grand capital of Chang'an from the Son of Heaven himself.\n\nWith the conquest of Chang'an, we now have access to new treasures as well as construction materials and monuments that we could bring back to our capital so we may create our own city eclipsing Chang'an in splendor. At the same time, however, the people of Chang'an have been instrumental, having defected to our forces during the Siege of Chang'an and allowing us to capture the city. Thus, perhaps we would be wise to reward them by investing into rebuilding what was destroyed in the siege and ensure their loyalty to the King of Zhao."
 mmetr_NAN_mission_events.7.a: "Bring the treasures and building materials back to $CAPITAL_CITY$"
 mmetr_NAN_mission_events.7.b: "Help the people of Chang'an restore their home."
 mmetr_NAN_mission_events.8.t: "Siege of Songping"
 mmetr_NAN_mission_events.8.desc: "We now have control of the Red River Delta, having seized the Tang regional center of administration of Songping after a brutal siege. When our armies entered the city, we were welcomed by the Viet people who lived there as liberators, overjoyed that we had thrown of the shackles of centuries-long Chinese rule over the land of the Viets. While we could play the role of benevolent liberators and treat our new Viet subjects with magnanimity, the Viet lands are home to productive rice fields that are especially valuable to a growing kingdom. Thus, forcibly seizing direct control of these fields and extracting its crops would not win ourselves any favor from the populace but would still be of great benefit to the Zhao."
 mmetr_NAN_mission_events.8.a: "Live up to the expectations of the liberated Viets."
 mmetr_NAN_mission_events.8.b: "Extract as much as we can from the conquered Viets."
 mmetr_NAN_mission_events.9.t: "The Heavenly Empire of Zhao"
 mmetr_NAN_mission_events.9.desc: "When we Black and White Mywa established an autonomous state in Yunnan, we adopted the dynastic name of Zhao; however, the Tang referred to us as Nanzhao, meaning 'Southern Zhao,' due to our state being below the Tang in both geographical position as well as status, and we had no choice but to accept this name.\n\nToday, however, marks the birth of a new empire and the greatest moment in the history of our peoples. We have seized the Mandate of Heaven from those who have lost Heaven's favor, and our Emperor [Root.Monarch.GetName] has officially become the one and only Son of Heaven in the universe. Thus, perhaps it is time that we retire our old regional dynastic name and declare ourselves as the Zhao Empire."
 mmetr_NAN_mission_events.9.a: "We are the one and only Zhao!"
 mmetr_NAN_mission_events.9.b: "We must not forget our roots in the south."
 mmetr_NAN_mission_events.10.t: "The Question of Diplomacy"
 mmetr_NAN_mission_events.10.desc: "While we have built up friendly relations with the Emperor of China, we have not yet guaranteed a formal defensive agreement with their state. If we wish to pursue our ambitions outside of the lands of China without incurring the wrath of future emperors, perhaps it would be wise to submit tribute to the Emperor so we may never have to worry about any invasions from stronger powers."
 mmetr_NAN_mission_events.10.a: "We must receive their protection to pursue our ambitions."
 mmetr_NAN_mission_events.10.b: "There is no need to bow to another power."

 mmetr_Generic_events.1.t: "Order in the Colony"
 mmetr_Generic_events.1.desc: "We have successfully established order and justice in these new lands, and our colonial subjects seem to be satisfied somewhat, at least for the time being. Even so, we must act to establish a permanent contract between governors and administrators and our subjects. Do we wish to rule through trust and benevolence, or do we wish to impose our will upon our subjects?"
 mmetr_Generic_events.1.a: "Establish a mutually-agreed-upon social contract"
 mmetr_Generic_events.1.b: "Rule through strict enforcement of colonial law"
 mmetr_Generic_events.2.t: "Colonial Mobilization"
 mmetr_Generic_events.2.desc: "We are currently at war with another colonial state, a threatening foe that can be considered an equal both technologically and militarily. With calls from the mother country to mobilize our troops in this war, we will need to win over even those reluctant to fight for a war they may see as pointless. Thus, how should we frame this war in our official declarations?"
 mmetr_Generic_events.2.a: "We are fighting to protect our homes and families!"
 mmetr_Generic_events.2.b: "We are fighting to punish the aggressors who dare threaten our home!"

 mmetr_Generic_events.4.t: "Governor's Council of [Root.GetName]"
 mmetr_Generic_events.4.desc: "We have established the [Root.GetName] Governor's Council, a group of advisors who also serve as lead judiciaries in our colony. As our colony continues to prosper, we shall attract more talent of our own culture from the mother country who wish to climb the ranks and feed their families back home.\n\nHowever, we also have the option to open up high ranking positions such as those within the Governor's Council to individuals of talent living in, or even born in, the mother colony. Although we would not win any favors with those of our own culture this way, we would have a greater pool of untapped talent to choose from."
 mmetr_Generic_events.4.a: "Recruit up-and-coming officials from the mother country"
 mmetr_Generic_events.4.b: "Open opportunities to all, including those born in the colonies"
 mmetr_Generic_events.5.t: "Colonial Cities"
 mmetr_Generic_events.5.desc: "Through the efforts of our Governor and fellow colonists, we have established thriving cities in a land far from our mother country of [Root.Overlord.GetName]. Thus, as true pioneers of history like the ancient Romans and their coloniae, we have urbanized in a foreign land that we ourselves have built from the ground up."
 mmetr_Generic_events.5.a: "Our new home of [Root.GetName] shall know only prosperity!"
 mmetr_Generic_Germanic_mission_events.1.t: "Confederating the Vassal Tribes"
 mmetr_Generic_Germanic_mission_events.1.desc: "As our vassals fight with us on the battlefield against our enemies, a sense of unity has naturally been fostered between our vassal tribes and our own [Root.GetAdjective] people. The Germanic tribes have confederated over time thanks to internal factors and external threats, a similar development to our own. Thus, with our vassals identifying more and more with the war banners of [Root.GetName], we have the choice of either promoting further confederation and eventual integration of these vassals or allowing our vassals to retain autonomy as long as they continue to support us in military affairs."
 mmetr_Generic_Germanic_mission_events.1.a: "Our vassals can earn their autonomy through battle."
 mmetr_Generic_Germanic_mission_events.1.b: "Promote further confederation of the vassal tribes."
 mmetr_Generic_Germanic_mission_events.2.t: "Wild Boar's Head Formation"
 mmetr_Generic_Germanic_mission_events.2.desc: "The majority of Germanic armies are made up of infantry, fighting on foot in tight formations. One of these formations is the wedge, also known to us as the 'Keil,' or 'wild boar's head.' The Keil is a trapezoid-shaped formation which allows a band of warriors to pierce and shatter enemy formations on foot. The wedge also places our chief and the most skilled and heavily armored warriors at the front.\n\nThe Keil is strong on all sides, which has allowed us to split apart the formations of even the Roman legions. On the other hand, the Keil can be as devastating to the user as it can be to the enemy - an army using the wedge would be at risk of total annihilation in the event of a retreat, since the collapse of the front would break the entire Keil wedge formation. Fortunately for us, this means that our loyal warriors will be bound by their oath and follow their chief in the vanguard to either victory or death."
 mmetr_Generic_Germanic_mission_events.2.a: "Our warriors shall never fall with their backs to the enemy."
 mmetr_Generic_Germanic_mission_events.3.t: "Sacred Grounds of [Root.GetName]"
 mmetr_Generic_Germanic_mission_events.3.desc: "Unlike the Romans' urban temples of stone and concrete, our worship is based around the gods in nature, with our holiest sites including sacred trees and groves as well as tumuli - the burial mounds of our ancestors. Thanks to the blessing of the gods, we have successfully expanded our confederation, securing numerous new holy sites and sacred groves as their new protectors. This allows us to conduct ritualistic and religious ceremonies on a grander scale in forests across Germania."

 mmetr_Generic_Germanic_mission_events.5.desc: "The lands of what the Romans call Magna Germania had never been united before our great [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] began the path of unification. While the Romans were never able to conquer much of Germania, only leading punitive expeditions into our lands, the Romans nonetheless underestimated the Germani. With the union of all of the Germanic tribes of the heartland of Germania, we have now struck fear into the hearts of the Romans and any of our rivals who looked down upon us, and it would be fair for us to now declare ourselves as the ruler of all of the Germani."
