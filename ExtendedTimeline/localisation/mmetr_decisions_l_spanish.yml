 petition_for_imperial_court_rank_decision_desc:1 "Although the Emperor himself does not possess much in the way of political or martial power, the renown carried by possessing a court rank granted to us by the Emperor himself continues to be a symbol of prestige. Thus, should we acquire enough renown as well as bargaining power with the court, we would be able to petition for the acquisition of a court rank that shall serve our best interests.\n\n§TThis Decision can be taken more than once to increase the current ruler's court rank, with the prestige requirement increasing with each promotion in rank. Ranks are lost upon ruler death. The lowest acquirable rank is Senior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade, while the maximum rank is Senior First Rank.§!"
