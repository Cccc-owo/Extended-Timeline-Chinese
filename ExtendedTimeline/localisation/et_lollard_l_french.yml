 lollard: "Lollard"
 lollard_religion_desc: "Lollardism is a Christian denomination that originated in England in the 14th century. They translated the bible from Latin into and gave sermons in the common people's language. Lollards believe that very pious laymen have the same clerical authority as a priest, thus they don't accept the Catholic Church hierarchy. An important aspect of the Lollard faith is the striving for apostolic poverty, combined with the taxation of the clergy. Furthermore the Lollards don't believe that the church practices of baptism and confession are necessary for salvation. Confession to a priest is seen as unnecessary, because a priest doesn't have the ability to forgive one's sins. Lollards are pacifist and reject the idea of war, especially the idea of Crusades against heathens. They also reject the concept of clerical celibacy and think priests should not hold government positions."
