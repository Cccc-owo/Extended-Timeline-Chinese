 string_start_rom_58:0 "After a ruinous civil war, the Roman republic became far too unstable, resulting in Augustus declaring himself emperor.\n\nWith the power of the famous Roman legions, Rome has grown into the most powerful empire in the history of man and now, during Pax Romana our wealth and prosperity in unmatched. Despite this, the integrity of the empire is far from secured. To the east lies the Parthian Empire that rivals us in military strength and to the north, various barbarian tribes yearn for the riches of Rome. Despite this, the biggest threats may dwell within the empire, as the senate still clings to the power they had during the republic and even the powerful Roman legions are a double-edged sword, as the generals controlling those armies possess the power to overthrow the emperor if they deem it necessary."
 string_start_hnd_58:0 "The Han Dynasty has been the dominant force in asia, and controller of China proper for over 200 years. By now, many have attempted to topple it with the latest attempt being by Wang Mang, who proclaimed himself emperor of the Xin Dynasty in 9CE. However, his rule was short, as in 23CE a rebellion broke out and restored the Han Dynasty. The next few years saw some political instability, but the empire is now in a steady process of recovery. The borders of the empire are also mostly secure, as the biggest threat, the nomadic Xiongnu to the north, recently suffered from a civil war of their own greatly decreasing their strength. The empire is safe for the time being, however internal instability could always return to become a problem."
 string_start_igr_58:0 "We are the last. Over three centuries ago, our ancestors strode triumphantly across the vast, smoldering remnants of the once unbeatable Persian Empire. Under the leadership of Alexander, the greatest leader in history, it seemed Greek culture, Greek learning, and Greek civilization would rule the entire world, from the fertile lands of Europe to the deserts of Asia. We were wrong. The Empire collapsed into warring states, the strongest being the tyrannical Seleucids, who our Bactrian ancestors revolted against. Our current state was founded by the general Apollodotus, when he refused to let the Indian provinces take part in the civil wars that would eventually lead to Bactria's destruction at the hands of steppe barbarians. Now, Bactria and the Seleucid Empire are ruled by new Kushan and Parthian regimes, whose lapdogs have occupied the vast majority of our country.\n\nAs the last free Greeks in the whole world, a difficult choice faces us. Once we push the Indo-Scythians and Kushans back across the Hindu Kush, should we continue west, attempting to restore Alexander's empire and eventually liberating our lost homeland from the distant Roman tyrants now ruling it? Or should we accept that we are now Indian, and try to build a new home and power for ourselves in Asia? Either way we must act fast to occupy weak nearby states to gain a chance against the enemy hordes."
 string_start_rom_224:0 "After a ruinous civil war, the Roman republic became far too unstable, resulting in Augustus declaring himself emperor.\n\nWith the power of the famous Roman legions, Rome has grown into the most powerful empire in the history of man and now, during Pax Romana our wealth and prosperity in unmatched. Despite this, the integrity of the empire is far from secured. To the east lies the Sassanid Empire that rivals us in military strength and to the north, various barbarian tribes yearn for the riches of Rome. Despite this, the biggest threats may dwell within the empire, as the senate still clings to the power they had during the republic and even the powerful Roman legions are a double-edged sword, as the generals controlling those armies possess the power to overthrow the emperor if they deem it necessary."
 string_start_sas_224:0 "Sassanid Ardashir the First has defeated his Parthian overlord, Artabanus the Fourth. His victory broke the Parthian rule, and made the Persian Sassanid dynasty the ruling dynasty, with him on the throne. As his realm is finally ruled by a true Persian, it enters its best period in history, a golden age of Persia.\nYet, the rivals are still there. The Roman Empire to the west is still a big, civilized threat. The Empire of Kushan to the east is also a worthy, powerful rival. There are many opportunities, though. Will the new, reborn Sassanid Persia rise to the glory never seen since the days of the Achaemenid Empire, or succumb to the internal strife that is still going on after the defeat of former Parthian rulers?"
 string_start_row_395:0 "The great civilization of Rome is under attack. In the west, barbarians continue to threaten the unstable and declining country and unrest grows throughout the roman provinces as the mixture of violent cultures proves to be destructive. The country has been redivided after the death of Theodosius the I and Honorius takes the throne. With the recent adoption of Christianity, the empire tries it's best to convert the lands to the true faith. Can Honorius restore the empire to glory with his brother Arcadius of the Eastern Roman Empire, and save it from falling into heathen, uncivilized hands?"
 string_start_frk_395:0 "The Sicambri Dynasty of the Frankish tribes have created a dominant presence in Germania, and continue to unite the people for one cause. Seizing the land of the Romans, and reclaiming their lost lands is a very prestigious goal. Genobald I has already led the tribe to victory once in 388 against the Romans, what's to stop him from claiming another? Can he bring the Frankish tribes to further glory?"
 string_start_hns_395:0 "The Huns have grown exponentially in the last 50 years, with Uldin leading his horde to uniting most of Scythia. No one can look at a Hunnish horde without fainting, and no army can fight one without being shattered, or decimated completely. With an unstable Eastern Roman Empire after the death of Theodosius the First, there is surely opportunity for the Hunnish tribes. A future to look forward to. Can Uldin, and his successors, forge an everlasting state in Europe?"
 string_start_gok_637:0 "Göktürks power diminished after the independence of the Western Khanate. The Göktürk Khanate is now divided into two parts, while the Khan's eternal enemy the Tang Dynasty grows restless of our raids and from lands afar rises a new religion. Will Chebi Khan unite the great Turkish Khanate against our eternal enemy? Will the Göktürk Khanate be lost in history? or will it be an empire whose name would echo through ages to come?"
 string_start_sas_637:0 "It seems like all the holiness of Ahura Mazda has left Iran - Heathen Arabs of the desert, organized under the banner of Islam, a new, powerful religion, are ravaging Persia, defeating their armies one after another! The strife between Yazdegerd III and the nobility has reached the levels of a civil war, so no one can organize a response to the invaders. The Arab invaders are preaching Islam far and wide with their conquests. They also took the pride of Persia, their capital, Ctesiphon, and sacked it.\nDire times for the Iranian realm are already there. Will the Sassanid dynasty save what's left from the ancient Iran? Is Yazdeged the Third able to fend off the Arab wave of destruction?"
 string_start_avr_637:0 "The Avar Khaganate has migrated to Pannonia a long time ago, with their fierce horseback army of the steppes. They are capable warriors, pillaging and extracting tribute from the surrounding states. Western chronicles refer to them as "Huns", because Avar horseback warriors are as ruthless and effective as the actual tribe of Huns, who came here before them. Will the Khaganate under the leadership of Bayan expand its infulence further west? Can it mark its place in history?"
 string_start_srr_637:0 "While most of the Avar kin left their homeland to claim the steppes and the glory of pillaging their enemies, some of them stayed. They settled down and founded a kingdom of Sarir, and they got christianized, unlike their Tengrist steppe brothers. \nWith a new religion called Islam rising in the south, and expanding dangerously northwards, Kotrag might be forced to look for an alliance to secure the existence of his state, and fend off the Muslim invaders when the time comes."
 string_start_eng_1066:0 "When Edward the Confessor died without an heir in 1066, it seemed that Harold Godwinson, a person whose family has been steadily gaining power in the realm over the past decade, would succeed the throne. However, it then became known that Edward promised the throne to not only Harold, but also to William II in Normandy, and also Harald Hardrada in Norway! The English throne is now being fought over. The people of England don't want to have to live, once again, under viking rule, not forgetting the dark memories of the North Sea Empire under Denmark only a few decades ago. However, even under the Normans, the Kingdom would still lose its independence. Uncertain and dark times are ahead for the Anglo-Saxon people. Can Harold Godwinson successfully defend his home country from the vikings and conquerors? Or will he, his dynasty, culture, and country be lost and forgotten in time, like the now distant memory of the Roman Empire? The question is for you to decide."
 string_start_bri_1241:0 "The Duke, Jean Ier de Dreux, descendent of King Louis VI is a good ally of the King of France, Louis IX. But on the coasts, the English spread their influence in Brittany, and the continental French divide us from the Empire.\n\nWill we ensure our independancy, hardly saved from immemorial times, will we unite the Celtic people under a common banner? Or shall we know the same fate that so many other duchies and small kingdoms before us."
 string_start_mal_1241:0 "In the 12th century, the Empire of Mali is in a unique position within West Africa. Her position between the vast goldfields in the Volta river valleys to the south and the lucrative salt mines in the northern sections of her borders had made Mali one of the premier economic forces on the planet at the time. The previous ruler, the great Mansa Musa, had expanded Malian territory to include gold mines on the Niger and Senegal Rivers, and the vital river trading posts of Timbuktu and Gao. The surge to Mali’s income allowed her to field a capable full-time army and provide security for the thousands of traders coming from Adalusia, Eastern Africa, and the Middle East. Musa’s passing has left the country in the unsure hands of his son, Maghan Keita, yet to be tested as a leader. With threats to trade and territorial boundaries from neighboring kingdoms, notably the Songhai, and a long standing feud with the Berbers of North Africa, only time will tell if Maghan can continue to expand his father’s imperial legacy or if he will oversee Mali’s fall from grace."
 string_start_ser_1337:0 "With help of influential nobles and clergy in 1331 Stefan Dusan was crowned king of Serbia and has expanded Serbia significantly in a short amount of time. However, our position is not yet completly secure. Byzantium is weakened, but they are atill a danger to Serbia. Hungary has claimed our northern lands and war is likely to escalate. Ottomans are becoming stronger and are probably becoming a major rival in the Balkans in the near future."
 string_start_ser_1836:0 "In 1817 Serbia became an autonomous principality within the Ottoman Empire. With power frequently changing between two competing dynasties, they couldn't make any significant reforms in the short time they ruled. To the north of us, the hostile Habsburg monarchy holds our core lands in Vojvodina. Serbia's overlord, and the only other neighbour, Ottomans, are powerful but not invincible. With smart diplomatic play and stronger military they could be beaten."
 string_start_tex_1836:0 "The government of New Spain faced serious problems from Comanche raids in their territory of Tejas, and so an agreement was made with the USA that would allow limited settlement of Texas by American settlers, provided that these meet a number of criteria, including the conversion to Roman Catholicism and the freedom of any slaves brought into the territory. This agreement was later affirmed by Mexico, however many of the Americans did not accept the conditions placed upon them.\n\nIn 1825 a census of Austin's Colony showed 1347 Anglo-Americans and 443 people of African descent, almost all slaves. The settlers meanwhile complained that New Spain and later Mexico did not protect American settlers, and thus the settlers didn't need to meet the conditions imposed upon them. On 16th December 1826, Haden Edwards, his brothers, and thirty American settlers declared independence as the Republic of Fredonia, but were ultimately quashed.\n\nOn 19th December 1832 a proclamation was issued to the Mexican Congress complaining of a lack of protection from natives; poor pay for militias; insufficient local and legislative representation; forbidding of further immigration from the USA; lack of funding for schools; and violations of the Constitution of 1824. Some attempts were made to address concerns by the settlers in 1833 but it was too little and too late.\n\nTexas has declared independence, and driven out the Mexican army, yet the USA, afraid to antagonise Mexico, or tip the balance of power in favour of the slave states, is yet to recognise Texas as a new state of the union. Trapped between powerful neighbours, Texas must make a choice, to continue to seek American recognition as a state; to return to Mexico and seek to address its grievances within the legal system amid increasingly hostile race relations; or to carve its own path, independent from both the USA and Mexico."
 string_start_usa_1861:0 "The U.S. was engulfed in a bitter conflict over slavery ever since its founding, but the invention of cotton gin that precipitated slavery in the south combined with the urbanization of the north polarized the two regions. The two disagreed over a number of political issues, such as national railroads, tariffs, homesteads, and above all, the expansion of slavery to the western territories. The tension came to a head when Republican Presidential candidate Abraham Lincoln was elected with just 39% of the popular vote, not even appearing on the ballot in many southern states. Though he swore he had no intention of abolishing slavery in the southern states, the antebellum South pulled out of the U.S., believing secession was the only path to protecting the southern way of life.\n\nThe Union must put down the 'southern rebellion' to keep the country together, while preventing European powers from aiding the Confederates and forever dividing America in two."
 string_start_csa_1861:0 "The fire-eaters have pushed eleven former U.S. slave-states over the edge, convincing their state legislatures to back out of the United States and form the Confederate States of America. The war is a result of many factors, particularly the regional and sectional differences of the two parts of the U.S., but secession from the Union was begot primarily from a fear of the abolition of slavery.\n\nTo achieve independence and the formation of a slave empire, the Confederacy must fight a long defensive war against the militarily and technologically advanced North, while simultaneously preventing our own union of states from splintering apart from within.\n\nEven if we succeed, the Americas will be greatly weakened as a result of a divided great power, but if we fail, the traditional lifestyle of the southern U.S. will be lost forever."
 string_start_ser_1914:0 "After the murder of Aleksandar Obrenovic in 1903, the parliament appointed a new king, Aleksandar Karadjordjevic.  After 500 years of occupation Serbia is now completly independent, but Ottomans and Austrians still hold a lot of Serbian core lands. The idea that all southern Slavs should be united under one nation is becoming popular amongst the people. The constitution of 1888 has been restored and Serbia is now a young constitutional monarchy. Force might be necessary to drive off Turks and Austrians from Balkan. Surrounded by enemies and poverty, can Serbia keep its recently gained independence?"
 string_start_ger_1939:0 "After a disastrous defeat in WW1, Germany was crippled militarily, diplomatically, and economically. Billions in war reparations coupled with hyperinflation resulted in a severe economic depression. Desperate for change, the German people turned to a new party, the National Socialists, and its leader, Adolf Hitler, to turn things around. After seizing power and reforming Germany into a fascist dictatorship, Adolf Hitler began an aggressive campaign to turn his nation into a global empire spanning all of Europe and beyond, and used eugenics to assert that the people of Germany were ethnic Aryans, a supposed 'master race', and slowly began the mass genocide of Jews across Europe. Hitler annexed both Czechoslovakia and Austria, and the rest of the world finally drew the line at the German invasion of Poland, with Great Britain and France being the first to declare war as the second global conflict in just 20 years began.\n\nCan Germany succeed in forming the next global empire? Or will WW2 result in a defeat even worse than WW1?"
 string_start_sov_1947:0 "A new era for Soviet Russia has emerged. After the conclusion of WWII, the Soviets has reigned over all of Eastern Europe. They have defeated the fascists, and now, the democratic countries of the Western world challenge them. In the wake of this ideological conflict, relations have worsened, forming a rivalry between two very different ideologies. However, one question remains: Who will come out on top, capitalism or communism?"
 string_start_ger_1947:0 "A age of division has dawned upon Germany. After being humiliated after the defeat of two world wars, Germany has been split in two. With capitalism in the west and communism in the east, they have both been subjugated by superpowers. With the country now split in two by the iron curtain and the two halves stuck on opposing sides of a new cold war, reunification seems impossible. But, if the impossible were to happen, which system would Germany unite under? Capitalism or communism?"
 string_start_usa_1947:0 "A new age has emerged on America and the Western World. Ever since the collapse of the Third Reich and the end of WW2 in 1945, the world has been dominated by two ideologies: capitalism and communism. After Soviet Russia set up communist puppet governments all over Eastern Europe, relations between the west and the east greatly deteriorated, and now, a new ideological conflict is upon us. However, with the invention of nuclear weaponry a new world war could end up in the destruction of both sides. Thus it is in our interests to keep the conflict cold and prevent escalation into full scale war. In this new type of indirect warfare it's not clear who will come out on top, capitalism or communism."
 string_start_ger_1991:0 "The stage is set for prosperity in Germany. After the fall of German Democratic Republic and the reunification of Germany, Germany has been in complete economic, political, and domestic peace, unseen for nearly a century. Germany now has the chance to retake prosperity not held for a very long time, if only it can make the peace last. To ensure lasting peace in Europe, perhaps increased co-operation between the major powers of Europe could be in order."
 string_start_usa_present:0 "The modern era has seen the U.S. grow to be the greatest military and economic force in the world. Consumerism thrives and popular culture permeates every facet of life. However, the rise of terrorism following the 9/11 attacks and tensions in the Middle East has spawned a new world order rife with conflict, sectionalism, nationalism, and global catastrophes such as Climate Change and World Hunger. The U.S. must work with its allies to balance world power and maintain peace across the globe in the face of various crises."
