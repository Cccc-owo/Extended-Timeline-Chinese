 #Umayyad Caliphate
 mmetr_UMA_mission_events.1.t: "Kharijites Rebel!"
 mmetr_UMA_mission_events.1.desc: "As a result of increased Umayyad probing and crackdown of Kharijite activity, the more militant Kharijites have been provoked into openly rebelling against the Caliph. This, however, is all according to plan, as defeating the Kharijites in a decisive battle now will end this thorn in our side once and for all!"
 mmetr_UMA_mission_events.1.a: "We shall not allow them to divide us, the true believers!"
 
 #Ayyubid Sultanate of Egypt
 mmetr_EGY_mission_events.1.t: "Emirate of Sicily Restored"
 mmetr_EGY_mission_events.1.desc: "With the valuable island of Sicily captured once more under the banner of Islam, we now have the question of how we want to govern the island. Since we do not have direct land access to the island, and since it is quite far away from our central government in Syria, there are some in our court who believe that an emir should be appointed to lead a semi-autonomous Emirate of Sicily. Thus, they would support us in wars and send us tribute while governing autonomously with our best interests in mind. On the other hand, we could directly govern the island as we do our other territories, with the emir serving as role similar to a governor."
 mmetr_EGY_mission_events.1.a: "The Emir shall rule autonomously as a vassal state."
 mmetr_EGY_mission_events.1.b: "The shall have direct rule over the Emirate."
 mmetr_EGY_mission_events.1.tt: "The Emirate of §YSicily§! is created from the provinces of Sicily and is made our §Yvassal§!"
 mmetr_EGY_mission_events.2.t: "The Order of the Assassins"
 mmetr_EGY_mission_events.2.desc: "The Hashashin are an order of followers of the Nizari Isma'ili sect of Shia Islam. They have an infamous history of conducting assassinations on high-ranking figures, even rulers, in both the Christian and Islamic realms - the word 'assassin' itself comes from their name, the Hashashin. Though a dangerous threat to us, attempting to destroy their order may be riskier than seeking out a mutual friendship through finding a common enemy.\n\nWe have persuaded them to side with us for now, but we may need to give something more substantial for them to remain loyal. Thus, some in our court believe that we could grant them a larger domain beyond their Masyaf Castle in Hamah in exchange for assisting us against our enemies."
 mmetr_EGY_mission_events.2.a: "Grant the Assassins their own domain"
 mmetr_EGY_mission_events.2.b: "Let us not go too far with our generosity..."
 mmetr_EGY_mission_events.3.t: "Christian Refugees Sent Home"
 mmetr_EGY_mission_events.3.desc: "By establishing friendly diplomatic relations with a Catholic state, we have found a safe and guaranteed home for the Catholics in our lands who wish to return to Europe. Thus, the Catholics from one of our provinces have been sent back to Europe and will be received warmly by the trustworthy Catholic nation that we have befriended. Though the cultural impact that the Catholic crusaders have left on the province may not change so easily, at the very least our own faith will become the majority religion in the province from which the Catholic refugees shall be leaving."
 mmetr_EGY_mission_events.3.a: "May God keep them safe during their long journey home."
 mmetr_EGY_mission_events.4.t: "Christian Refugees Sent Home"
 mmetr_EGY_mission_events.4.desc: "The Ayyubid dynasty of Egypt, who we have established friendly relations with, has ensured the safe passage of Christian refugees from the conquered crusader states in the Levant to our own country. With the acceptance of these Catholic refugees, we now have the ability to integrate the wandering Christians into taxable subjects."
 mmetr_EGY_mission_events.4.a: "We shall accept them with open arms."
 
 #ITA Odoacer Italy
 mmetr_ITA_Odoacer_mission_events.1.t: "Germanic Rex of Rome"
 mmetr_ITA_Odoacer_mission_events.1.desc: "We have achieved the height of Germanic power, with our domain stretching from Hispania to Italy. Almost all former territories of the Western Roman Empire have been reunited under a single ruler once more, our king in Italy. With our new vast empire, the title of Rex of Italia is no longer applicable, for we rule a realm much greater than Italy proper. Thus, let us discard all pretenses of subordination to the Roman emperor in Constantinople and officially declare ourselves the true Rex of the city of Rome!"
 mmetr_ITA_Odoacer_mission_events.1.a: "Long live the king of Rome!"
 mmetr_ITA_Odoacer_mission_events.2.t: "Question of the State Religion"
 mmetr_ITA_Odoacer_mission_events.2.desc: "Although most of the Germanic peoples in our realm, both nobles and soldiers alike, are followers of Arian Christianity, the vast majority of Romans in Italy follow the Chalcedonian doctrine established by the Roman Empire in the ecumenical council of Chalcedon.\n\nDo we wish to carry on with our current faith, or do we wish to convert to a new faith to suit our subjects who are perceived as heretical?"
 mmetr_ITA_Odoacer_mission_events.2.a: "Is it not enough to simply tolerate the heretics?"
 mmetr_ITA_Odoacer_mission_events.2.b: "We must convert to the true faith!"
 
 #SAS Sassanids
 mmetr_SAS_mission_events.1.t: "Emissary to China"
 mmetr_SAS_mission_events.1.desc: "Our great influence over the Silk Road trade in Sogdia has granted us greater access to information regarding the Emperor of the rich land of China. Thus, we have put together an expedition directly to the lands of China itself with an emissary requesting formal trade and diplomatic relations with the Chinese empire. As a result, our emissaries and traders have been able to map out a significant portion of the northern lands of the far east. This also opens up opportunities for greater diplomacy and cooperation with the Emperor of China in the future."
 mmetr_SAS_mission_events.1.a: "Splendid."
 mmetr_SAS_mission_events.2.t: "A Stable Persian Realm"
 mmetr_SAS_mission_events.2.desc: "With stability returned to the lands of Eranshahr once more, we can now sleep more soundly at night knowing our people are safe. Despite this security, we cannot ignore the fact that the various estates of our realm shall continue to squabble and fight for influence.\n\nThus, while the land is stable and our subjects are loyal, let us take our next steps after heeding the advice of our closest subjects - the mowbed chief priests who administer the realm; the noble warrior caste that fights and leads our battles; and the trade and merchant syndicate, which handles all matters related to coin and trade. Though turning to them on just one day is a small gesture, it shall go a long way in building trust with the estate whose advice we choose to heed in these prosperous times."
 mmetr_SAS_mission_events.2.a: "Turn to the mowbeds for guidance"
 mmetr_SAS_mission_events.2.b: "We can trust the merchant syndicate"
 mmetr_SAS_mission_events.2.c: "Listen to those who win our battles"
 mmetr_SAS_mission_events.3.t: "Kingdom of the Lakhmids"
 mmetr_SAS_mission_events.3.desc: "The former coastal domains of the Arab kingdom of the Lakhmids have been brought under our rule. Being in a region that is culturally and geographically different from our homeland of Fars, the coastal Arabian region might benefit from allowing the local former Lakhmid dynasts to govern their lands on our behalf."
 mmetr_SAS_mission_events.3.a: "Allow the local Arabs to govern"
 mmetr_SAS_mission_events.3.b: "We shall rule the Arab land directly"
 mmetr_SAS_mission_events.4.t: "Trade and Merchant Syndicate"
 mmetr_SAS_mission_events.4.desc: "Having completed many tasks in accordance with the wishes of the merchant and trade syndicate, the head of the syndicate, the Ho Tohkshan Bod, has decided to directly support the state in return. Though the merchants usually work autonomously and only trade on behalf of the Sasanian state, we now have the opportunity to direct our Persian merchants towards a common goal with our ruler at the helm."
 mmetr_SAS_mission_events.4.a: "Seek trade allies to direct trade towards our own ports"
 mmetr_SAS_mission_events.4.b: "Establish greater cooperation between trade fleets"
 mmetr_SAS_mission_events.4.c: "Expand the ranks of the trade syndicate"
 mmetr_SAS_mission_events.5.t: "Legacy of the Pishdadians"
 mmetr_SAS_mission_events.5.desc: "When the lands of the great king Fereydun of the Pishdadian dynasty, the legendary first Iranian dynasty, were divided between his sons after his death, Iran and Turan emerged as two separate realms that would go on to become major rivals, with Iran eventually emerging victorious to become the undisputed rulers of the world. Now, our Shahanshah has conquered Turan, accomplishing what our Iranian forefathers of the first Iranian dynasty of the Pishdadians had thousands of years ago. Let us now emulate the great king Fereydun and vanquish to forces of our own Zahhak, that which represents all evil in the world!"
 mmetr_SAS_mission_events.5.a: "We are now Shah of Iran as well as Turan!"
 mmetr_SAS_mission_events.6.t: "Kushanshah"
 mmetr_SAS_mission_events.6.desc: "The Kushans have been driven out of their own homeland, and we have established Sassanid rule in their place. The local govenors have been granted permission to mint their own coins, and they have taken the title of 'Kushanshah' in order to be respected as the new rulers of their Kushan subjects. With this administration in place, perhaps we would benefit from assigning these frontier lands of our empire to the Kushanshahs and allow them to rule on behalf of the Sassanid throne as a client state."
 mmetr_SAS_mission_events.6.a: "Give Turan to the Kushanshahs"
 mmetr_SAS_mission_events.6.b: "No territories shall change hands"
 mmetr_SAS_mission_events.6.tt1: "All provinces in the Ghor, Kabulistan and Balkh areas are ceded to a new §YKushano-Sassanid§! vassal state"
 mmetr_SAS_mission_events.6.tt2: "All provinces in the Ghor, Kabulistan and Balkh areas are ceded to the §YKushano-Sassanids§! vassal state"
 mmetr_SAS_mission_events.7.t: "Dehqan Appeasement"
 mmetr_SAS_mission_events.7.desc: "The petty landholding magnates known as the dehqan handle adminstration and tax collection at the provincial and even village levels. Our moves to appease not only the highest class of nobles, those who influence the imperial court itself, but also the lower class of nobles including the dehqan has earned us many favors from the sometimes overlooked dehqan class. As a result, having the favor of the dehqan means they will strive to serve us well, and it also decreases the likelihood of embezzlement or other treacherous acts at the local level."
 mmetr_SAS_mission_events.7.a: "It is only fair that no noble shall be given primacy over the others"
 mmetr_SAS_mission_events.8.t: "Sasanian Cataphracts"
 mmetr_SAS_mission_events.8.desc: "The most prestigious of the Azadan warrior nobility, the Asvaran are armored archers and cavalrymen who oftentimes decide the outcomes of our battles. Thus, the Asvaran cataphracts, armored cavalrmen, are especially valuable to the Sasanian army, and their fame is enough for our enemies to be immobilized by fear upon just seeing our armored warriors appear over the horizon."
 mmetr_SAS_mission_events.8.a: "Glory to the armored knights of Persia!"
 mmetr_SAS_mission_events.9.t: "King Xerxes' Dream"
 mmetr_SAS_mission_events.9.desc: "We have succeeded in what not even the Achaemenid dynasty could achieve: the complete and utter subjugation of the heartland of Greece. While the armies of the Greek city-states were able to halt Achaemenid expansion in the Persian Wars, their descendants now kneel before us. Many centuries and many descendants later, we have finally realized the dream of Xerxes the Great, concluding the Greco-Persian wars once and for all."
 mmetr_SAS_mission_events.9.a: "Glory to the true Persian Empire!"
 mmetr_SAS_mission_events.10.t: "The Three Great Fires"
 mmetr_SAS_mission_events.10.desc: "Ever since we usurped the Parthian dynasty, we have strived to prove ourselves better rulers than our former rivals and true heirs to the Persian Empire. While the fire temple in Azar Barzin was built by our former Parthian rivals, it is far too holy and prestigious for us to dismantle. Thus, we have instead built up two more fire temples of our own to eclipse the fame of the Parthian flame: one in Azar Goshnasp in Media, and one in Azar Farnbag in our homeland of Fars.\n\nWe have also associated each of these Three Great Fires with a certain aspect of society: Azar Goshnasp is associated with warriors; Azar Farnbag is associated with the magi priests; lastly, and certainly least, is the Parthian fire of Azar Barzin, which we have associated with the absolute lowest estate, the farmers and herdsmen. That should show all of our superiority over the Parthians!"
 mmetr_SAS_mission_events.10.a: "The flames shall burn for eternity, for Ahura Mazda!"
 
 #VAN Vandals / Vandalia
 mmetr_VAN_mission_events.1.t: "The Sack of Rome"
 mmetr_VAN_mission_events.1.desc: "Our Vandal armies have finally breached the walls of Rome! As our soldiers poured into the Eternal City in search of plunder, they saw before them the head religious leader of Rome, who presents us an offer. The bishop offers to allow our Vandal forces to continually plunder the city for several days without resistance, as long as we do not lay waste to the city of Rome or slaughter its inhabitants. Although we clearly possess more bargaining power in this situation, perhaps we should act as peaceful plunderers if it means we can resume our plunder without resistance. Of course, even if we do take the offer, no one will be able to stop us if we decide to take several Romans back as slaves."
 mmetr_VAN_mission_events.1.a: "Take the bishop's offer"
 mmetr_VAN_mission_events.1.att: "Plunder more gold from the Romans and take back slaves to boost capital production, but deal less damage to the city itself"
 mmetr_VAN_mission_events.1.b: "We care not for their attempts at persuasion!"
 mmetr_VAN_mission_events.1.btt: "Deal great damage to Rome and take back slaves to boost capital production, but pillage the city less extensively"
 mmetr_VAN_mission_events.2.t: "The Sack of Rome - Bishop's Offer Accepted"
 mmetr_VAN_mission_events.2.desc: "When our Vandal armies breached the walls of Rome, we struck a deal with the Bishop of Rome: we would be allowed to loot the city in peace as long as we did not destroy the city or slaughter its inhabitants. Thus, our soldiers carried on with looting the great riches of the Eternal City, as well as captured several unfortunate Romans as slaves. Our soldiers spent many days in Rome plundering the city thoroughly, even taking prizes from the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus itself. By accepting their deal, it seems that we Vandals were given more time to meticulously plunder from every corner of the city without any pressure of having to retreat from the city."
 mmetr_VAN_mission_events.2.a: "We should thank the Romans for their generosity!"
 mmetr_VAN_mission_events.3.t: "The Sack of Rome - Bishop Ignored"
 mmetr_VAN_mission_events.3.desc: "Our Vandal soldiers pushed past the Bishop of Rome and his followers, completely ignoring the Bishop's desperate attemps at persuasion. The pathetic Romans could only look on in horror as we pillaged their great Eternal City as if it were just another common town ripe for plunder. Although accepting the bishop's offer would have given us more time to thoroughly plunder the city without the pressure of having to retreat from the city, the amount of destruction and devastation we have brought upon the Romans' home city more than makes up for the shorter duration of plundering."
 mmetr_VAN_mission_events.3.a: "Seize everything of worth in the city!"
 mmetr_VAN_mission_events.4.t: "Dealing with the Heretics"
 mmetr_VAN_mission_events.4.desc: "We have successfully converted the majority of our subjects to the one true faith. Although we have been known to be especially... unkind... towards heretics in the past, with our recent successes and with the heretics and heathens now being a smaller minority of our populace, we now have to answer the question regarding whether we should continue with persecuting the heretics."
 mmetr_VAN_mission_events.4.a: "They shall convert or face the consequences!"
 mmetr_VAN_mission_events.4.b: "We can relax a bit on the persecution..."
 mmetr_VAN_mission_events.5.t: "Arian Patriarch of Africa"
 mmetr_VAN_mission_events.5.desc: "For the first time in Africa, we have established a centralized Arian church led by an influential patriarch, much like the Chalcedonian bishops who instead choose to spread a heretical and untrue doctrine."
 mmetr_VAN_mission_events.5.a: "May God bless the Patriarchate of Africa!"
 mmetr_VAN_mission_events.6.t: "Empire of the Vandals"
 mmetr_VAN_mission_events.6.desc: "With the conquest of Italia and Africa, we have established ourselves not only as a Germanic kingdom far from our homeland, but also as a great empire to be feared and respected by even the Romans of Constantinople. Thus, with German rule over not only the Mauri, but now over other groups of peoples such as the Italians, Greeks and Iberians, we can finally and officially declare the establishment of a Germanic empire in the Mediterranean!"
 mmetr_VAN_mission_events.6.a: "Glory to the Empire of Vandalia!"
 mmetr_VAN_mission_events.6.b: "We are an empire, but no government reform is needed"
 mmetr_VAN_mission_events.6.tt: "Government form does not change (the §YGermanic Empire§! government form can still be manually adopted using Reform Progress)"
 mmetr_VAN_mission_events.7.t: "Heretic Bishop of Carthage"
 mmetr_VAN_mission_events.7.desc: "The Chalcedonian Bishop of Carthage is a position that has remained vacant since we Vandals claimed the city of Carthage for ourselves. Although we have worked hard to establish Arianism as the dominant religion in Africa, allowing a new heretical bishop of Carthage to be appointed may gain us favors with the Romans in Constantinople."
 mmetr_VAN_mission_events.7.a: "The heretical bishop may stay in Carthage"
 mmetr_VAN_mission_events.7.b: "No heretic bishop shall ever have a seat in Carthage!"
 mmetr_VAN_mission_events.8.t: "Heirs of the Legacy of Carthage?"
 mmetr_VAN_mission_events.8.desc: "The Carthaginians were the bitterest of Rome's rivals during the days of the Republic. The Carthaginians were demonized by the Romans, much like how we Germans were labeled barbaric savages by the pompous Romans, the very same Romans who now lay dead and rotting at our feet. Thus, having established a great trade empire in Carthage and Africa, having integrated the local African people, and having avenged the Carthaginians who were massacred in the Punic Wars, perhaps we can claim the legacy of the old Carthaginians and establish ourselves as rivals of the Romans."
 mmetr_VAN_mission_events.8.a: "The spirit of Carthage reigns once more!"
 mmetr_VAN_mission_events.8.b: "We are Vandals, not Carthaginians..."
 
 #SAE Salerno
 mmetr_SAE_mission_events.1.t: "Merchants of Amalfi"
 mmetr_SAE_mission_events.1.desc: "The city of Amalfi was one of the earliest major trading powers in the Mediterranean, its prosperity equal to Pisa and Genoa. They were among the first Italians to trade in gold rather than through barter, and their unique access to the grain and silk trades give the nobles of Amalfi certain privileges in Muslim trade ports. Additionally, the Amalfian traders have created their own maritime code, the Tavole amalfitane, which regulates traffic, contracts and disputes; this code is so renowned that it has been adopted by many major port cities across the Mediterranean.\n\nSince the Amalfi nobles are currently dependencies of our princedom, we can use our vassal relationship with the city so we may also benefit from these Amalfian connections."
 mmetr_SAE_mission_events.1.a: "Adopt the Amalfi trade code"
 mmetr_SAE_mission_events.1.b: "Use Amalfi ties in Muslim ports"
 mmetr_SAE_mission_events.2.t: "The Legacy of Langobardia"
 mmetr_SAE_mission_events.2.desc: "The Principality of Salerno originated as a Lombard state that gained independence in the years following the fall of the Lombard Kingdom in Italy at the hands of the Carolingian Franks. By retaking the key cities of Lombardia, Pavia and Ravenna, we have proven ourselves true heirs to the legacy of the kingdom of the Lombards, Langobardia."
 mmetr_SAE_mission_events.2.a: "We are the true heirs of the Lombard Kings!"
 mmetr_SAE_mission_events.2.b: "We are Salernitanos, no more and no less"
 mmetr_SAE_mission_events.3.t: "Fealty to Constantinople?"
 mmetr_SAE_mission_events.3.desc: "Our cordial diplomatic relations with the Eastern Roman emperor has granted us a unique opportunity of becoming a dependency of the Eastern Roman Empire. We Salernitans have always played a balancing act between swearing loyalty to either the Carolingian or Eastern Roman emperors, while still retaining a high degree of autonomy. Thus, we can now make the same decision to seek Roman protection in exchange for regular tribute."
 mmetr_SAE_mission_events.3.a: "Let us swear our loyalty to Constantinople!"
 mmetr_SAE_mission_events.3.b: "We do not need their protection..."
 mmetr_SAE_mission_events.4.t: "Salerno Swears Fealty"
 mmetr_SAE_mission_events.4.desc: "The city of Salerno in Italy has sworn their loyalty to Constantinople. As previous dependencies of the Eastern Roman Empire, it is no surprise that they turn to us once more for protection."
 mmetr_SAE_mission_events.4.a: "We shall accept their tribute"
 mmetr_SAE_mission_events.4.tt: "Salerno becomes our §YTributary State§!"
 mmetr_SAE_mission_events.5.t: "Salerno Joins the Empire!"
 mmetr_SAE_mission_events.5.desc: "Our diplomacy with the Papal States and the Holy Roman Emperor have finally paid off. Once nominal subjects of the Carolingians, the Principality of Salerno has now officially been accepted as an official prince of the Holy Roman Empire!"
 mmetr_SAE_mission_events.5.a: "Glory to Salerno! Glory to the Empire!"
 mmetr_SAE_mission_events.6.t: "Lombard Nobles Defect!"
 mmetr_SAE_mission_events.6.desc: "The Lombard nobles of Apulia and Calabria have long despised Greek rule. Thus, through our own intrigue and cunning, we have secured their bloodless defection to our state. Although we have surely angered the Byzantines with this move, we did not march our own armies into the lands, making this not an act of aggression, but rather a peaceful change of hands. However, it is unlikely the Byzantines will agree with this assessment..."
 mmetr_SAE_mission_events.6.a: "Welcome our fellow Lombards into the Principality!"
 mmetr_SAE_mission_events.7.t: "Lombard Rebels Defect!"
 mmetr_SAE_mission_events.7.desc: "The Lombard nobles of southern Italy have often shown signs of their resentment of our rule. Thus, they have decided to defect over to the city of Salerno, another fellow principality of Lombard origin. While we do not know whether the Salernitan prince played any role in this betrayal, we have a feeling that some crafty scheming was carried out by the Salernitan prince and his courtiers."
 mmetr_SAE_mission_events.7.a: "Those slimy Salernitans!"

 mmetr_WSX_mission_events.1.desc: "Known as the 'threefold obligations,' the trinodas necessitas are the three things expected out of every Anglo-Saxon depending on their landholding status: military service, fortress work, and bridge repair. This keeps our men disciplined and always at the ready to serve in both wartime and peacetime capacities. With additional military reforms also inspired by the empire of the Franks, we have established standing, disciplined and mobile field armies."

 mmetr_WSX_mission_events.3.t: "Frontier Raiding"
 mmetr_WSX_mission_events.3.desc: "A secure frontier works both ways: it secures our state against foreign attacks, yet also allows us a secure foothold in the north from which we can launch raids into foreign territory, filling our coffers with the spoils."
 mmetr_WSX_mission_events.3.a: "More gold for our great kingdom!"
 
 #GUP Gupta Empire
 mmetr_GUP_mission_events.1.t: "Bengal Land Administration"
 mmetr_GUP_mission_events.1.desc: "Our exceptional Gupta administration has greatly benefited the lands of Bengal, both those under our direct rule as well as those under client rulers. We have divided the lands between ksetra (cultivated fields), khila (uncultivated fields), and vastu (sites of habitation), allowing for crop rotation of vast amounts of land as well as organized human settlement and population growth. Additionally, our accurate measuring system have allowed us to partition, administer and cultivate the Bengal lands with efficiency that has never been seen before in the region."
 mmetr_GUP_mission_events.1.a: "May the Delta feed our peoples in times of peace as well as war"
 mmetr_GUP_mission_events.2.t: "Legendary Heroes of Madhyadesha"
 mmetr_GUP_mission_events.2.desc: "The region of Madhyadesha, known as the 'middle country,' is sacred in Hinduism, as the splendid gods and heroes of the Ramayana and Mahabharata, the two great Indian epics, lived in Madhyadesha. Having consolidated the sacred lands of Madhyadesha under our rule, we have successfully tied our royal Gupta dynasty to the heroes of the Mahabharata and the Ramayana."
 mmetr_GUP_mission_events.2.a: "We carry the legacy of the heroes of old!"
 mmetr_GUP_mission_events.3.t: "Scientific Developments in the Gupta Empire"
 mmetr_GUP_mission_events.3.desc: "The talented scientists of the Gupta Empire have developed greatly in the fields of chemistry and metallurgy, which shall in turn support our endeavors in improving our state. Besides chemistry, scholarly experts in our empire have also made several advancements in the areas of mathematics, astronomy and philosophy."

 mmetr_GUP_mission_events.4.t: "Golden Age of India"
 mmetr_GUP_mission_events.4.desc: "Through our military might, we have restored peace to northern India; through the great minds of our finest scholars, scientists, artists and philosophers, we have experienced a cultural bloom never before seen in the lands of Jambudvipa. Thus, under our great and mighty Gupta dynasty, we have established not only peace but prosperity within our borders. Though we recognize the importance of humility, perhaps it could be fair to even say that we have achieved a new Golden Age in India."
 mmetr_GUP_mission_events.4.a: "May peace and prosperity define India for generations to come!"
 mmetr_GUP_mission_events.5.t: "The Question of Buddhism"
 mmetr_GUP_mission_events.5.desc: "Many Hindu emperors had been notable patrons of Buddhism in the past, including those of the Mauryan, Shunga, and now Gupta dynasties. We now run into the question of faith once more, as many rulers such as Ashoka have in the past: having been longtime patrons of the Buddhist faith, should we dedicate ourselves to becoming full-fledged students of the Lord Buddha himself?"
 mmetr_GUP_mission_events.5.a: "Adopt the popular Mahayana doctrine"
 mmetr_GUP_mission_events.5.b: "Adopt the ancient Theravada doctrine"

 mmetr_TYT_mission_events.1.desc: "Our lord and founder Toyotomi Hideyoshi was not always of the Toyotomi clan; born to the peasant Hashiba family, Hideyoshi rose through the ranks of Oda Nobunaga's forces and now serves as our esteemed Regent. With his ascension, he adopted the Toyotomi name, a new honsei, or original name, created by the imperial court for the purpose of boosting his legitimacy.\n\nWhile the original members of the Hashiba clan have adopted the new family name of Toyotomi, we have also granted the Toyotomi and Hashiba name to influential daimyo and other samurai families within our realm, expanding the Toyotomi family considerably."

 mmetr_TYT_mission_events.3.desc: "With Mitsuhide dead at the Battle of Yamazaki and the Akechi clan completely wiped out, the fields of battle were finally quiet, if only for a little while. Now, the current issue at hand was the question of who would succeed the late Nobunaga. Although an heir from the Oda would be nominally chosen as his heir, it was clear to all that with the Toyotomi forces in control of the majority of Nobunaga's former forces, it was none other than the Regent Toyotomi who would be in charge of the realm - our ruler shall also be the one to inherit the ambitions of Nobunaga himself and his dreams of Japanese unification."

With the expansion of the Toyotomi realm, we too may have the ability to create our own firearms, severing the need for any middlemen or over-reliance on the European firearms trade.

Although there is much animosity between the Saika-Ikki and the Toyotomi, as we are the successors of their former Oda enemies, their expertise in firearms and their abundance and quality of arquebus stockpile cannot be underestimated. Thus, by marching our troops to their lands in Kii, we have pressured the remaining Saika-Ikki to seek terms with us.\n\nTheir leader, possessing the title of Saika Magoichi, has offered to serve us in exchange for sparing his life.

Many empires in the past that established dynasties in Chinese lands had eventually integrated with Chinese culture itself to some extent, whether it be the Mongol Yuan dynasty, the Jurchen Jin, or the Khitan Liao.

Our predecessor, Oda Nobunaga, was fairly tolerant of this Christian religion and its missionaries. However, many in our court fear the threat of a new radical religion, as the radical Buddhist sect of the Ikko-Ikki proved to be a major threat to Oda Nobunaga's rule as well as the more moderate Shinto-Buddhist establishment.

Its followers practice the teachings of the Buddha, and many of its tenets are especially appealing to our people. Several members of the court have already converted, and many of our diplomats sent overseas have also converted to the Mahayana sect of Buddhism. On the local level, the teachings of the Buddha have been incorporated into Shinto beliefs, which means that instating Buddhism as a state religion would likely result in a rather smooth transition for our peoples, as the Shinto deities would not be set aside but instead incorporated into a Shinto-Buddhist faith."

Such a skilled maneuver requires absolute mastery of horsemanship. This tactic was made famous by the Parthian annihilation of the Roman armies of Crassus. When the Roman general Marcus Antonius returned to Parthia to avenge Crassus' humiliating defeat, our Parthian light cavalry devastated the Roman ranks once more - the Roman campaign was a disaster, and we Parthians sent them running back to Rome.\n\nSince then, our light cavalry have trained hard day and night to master the use of the Parthian shot in all types of terrains and weather conditions.

Great Parthian rulers and generals such as Mithridates the Great conquered the lands and satraps of the Seleukids, including the domains of Persia, Media and Babylonia, expanding the Parthian realm from a revolter kingdom to an empire rivaling that of the Greeks and Romans. However, we never truly had the opportunity to finish what we started, as the Romans subjugated the Seleukid heartland of Syria before we could do so.

Additionally, the Zoroastrian priests continue to kindle the fires of Cappadocia, and many Cappadocians still remain pious to this shared faith of ours.

Even so, we continue to have internal debates over the same topics covered in the ecumenical councils of the Romans, the primary discussion of which revolves around the nature of Christ. Known in the local Ethiopian language of Ge'ez as 'Tewahedo', meaning 'united as one,' a new belief among our peoples argues that there is a perfect union of the divine and human natures of Christ, rather than the belief in Rome and Greece that Christ possesses two natures, divine and human. As the rulers of Aksum, it is our role now to decide which doctrine shall be accepted."

By ensuring that the Beijun is always well-reinforced and supplied and led by capable generals chosen by merit rather than nepotism or bribery, we have begun the expansion of professional armies in an empire otherwise defended by commoner levies."

 mmetr_HND_mission_events.2.desc: "After much warring and treachery from the Xiongnu, the subjugation of the nomadic tribes of the north has been completed at last. Since our first war with the Xiongnu in the north many generations ago, our forefathers have fought fiercely and valiantly to defend our homeland from nomadic raids. To ensure the northern barbarians will not turn against us, we have tightened our system of tribute even further and promoted the settlement of Han Chinese colonists in former Xiongnu lands in the north."

This day, however, we have successfully established cordial relations with several tribes including those of the Qiang. Additionally, by sending commoner women falsely named as 'princesses' of the Han to secure marriage alliances with various Qiang chiefs, we have successfully acquired their full cooperation, including promises of military contributions during campaigns."

While our control over these commanderies loosened over time, we have now reestablished direct rule over the Four Commanderies of Han as well as tributary relations with the rest of the entire peninsula. The Korean commanderies are governed no differently than the commanderies in the Chinese heartland, allowing us to exert great control and influence over the local politics and economy of these Korean lands.

In a display of goodwill, the rulers of Wa have sent a wise and learned scholar who is here to study our way of life, politics, culture and philosophy so he may relay the new knowledge back to his homeland.

However, internal instability and civil strife had caused us to pull back from these lands over the years to instead deal with matters directly affecting the heartland of the Han empire. Now that we have restored our martial, political and economic authority over the oases of the Western Regions, perhaps it is time for us to reestablish the Protectorate of the Western Regions and appoint a Han Protector-General who shall assist us in our campaigns."

Now, the Liao remnants too have been defeated - though having called themselves Emperors, it seems that the Khitans of the Liao have been humbled by our armies and now realize the true Khagan rules over the Mongol tribes. Thus, we have accepted the sincere submission of the surviving Khitans - as with normal practice, we have furthermore divided and dispersed their soldiers across our realm so they may never unite against us and instead view Mongolia as home."

While most of the surviving Khwarezmians have surrendered in earnest to our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], some remnants of the Khwarezmian army have fled and moved elsewhere. Known as the Khwarazmiyya, the remnant army has been reduced to mere mercenaries without a home, seeking out any who are willing to spare them the coin for their service.

Thus, as a result of our conquests in Persia, we have acquired a great number of talented Persian artisans who we have distributed across the empire.

As a result of the siege and ensuring sacking of the city, much of the formerly-prosperous city of Baghdad has been destroyed. However, now as rulers rather than invaders, we must recognize the cultural, religious, intellectual and political significance of the city and how it could be used for our interests. Thus, we have appointed an Ilkhan, or 'Khan of the Tribe,' in Baghdad with the purpose of restoring the city to its former glory and governing our new territories in Mesopotamia.

While we have already slain many of the Hashashin who joined forces with our enemies during our campaigning in the Levant in the past, we have not truly dominated the lands surrounding their strongholds until now. Thus, it would be a shame if their skills in covert operations and assassination were gone to waste.

Among those captured in the conquest of Zhongdu is a Khitan Confucian scholar and statesman named Yelü Chucai. Yelü Chucai has gained the attention of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] thanks to his frank matter of speaking honest opinions, even if it is not necessarily what the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] wants to hear. Valuing talent above all else, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has offered Yelü Chucai a high-ranking position in our government.\n\nYelü Chucai seems to be an advocate for taxing conquered peoples rather than massacring them, arguing that while an empire can be conquered on horseback, it cannot be ruled on horseback. Thus, in consideration of his insight, we have chosen to implement a policy of more efficient taxation across the empire."

However, atypical to most sieges of our time, we permitted trade between the city's residents and our soldiers - some of the richest inhabitants sold their luxury belongings to us in exchange for food supplies, which they were severely lacking as a result of the siege. \n\nAs with standard practice, we have collected all of the loot sold to us by the city's inhabitants and have distributed them equally among the Mongol troops.

Thus, perhaps it would be more efficient for us and our Spanish subjects if we reorganized the various lords of the Spanish March and grant the lands to a single local dynasty that shall rule over all other lords.

Thus, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has been declared the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of both Ethiopia and Dhu Raydan.

With the decline of the Sabaean kingdom, we Himyarites have seized the capital of Ma'rib for ourselves. Inhabiting Ma'rib are grand temples almost as old as the city itself, dedicated to numerous deities such as Almaqah the moon god, Shams the sun god, along with many more gods favored by the Sabaeans.

The ruling tribe of Mecca, the Jurhum tribe, is itself of Yemeni origin, having come to power after our kings became custodians of the city.

The Second Temple, however, too was destroyed during the Great Jewish Revolt against the Roman Empire.\n\nWith the city of Jerusalem and the surrounding lands of Judea now under our protection, we have successfully emulated the actions of Solomon, Cyrus, Ezra and Nehemiah, constructing a grand and fine Third Temple of Jerusalem in the homeland of the Jews."

 mmetr_FUN_mission_events.2.desc: "With the exchanging of embassies with the Chinese court to the north, we have secured trading and diplomatic ties, increasing the renown of our kingdom. At the same time, this has also resulted in cultural exchange, as we have exchanged numerous ideas and innovations with the Chinese.\n\nWhile the Chinese have taken a liking to our fine ships, the most notable aspect of this diplomatic mission is the reaction of the Chinese ruler to our musicians. It seems that the Chinese ruler is so impressed by our musicians that they have established an institute for Funanese music in the imperial Chinese capital."

 mmetr_FUN_mission_events.3.t: "Musicians from Funan"
 mmetr_FUN_mission_events.3.desc: "We have exchange embassies with the kingdom of Funan, located across the southern seas. The kingdom of Funan controls several major trading ports between China and India - the importance of these ports as well as the unrivaled quality of Funanese ships, even in comparison to our own Chinese ships, are what prompted us to exchange embassies with them in the first place.\n\nCuriously, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has become especially fascinated by the Funanese musicians that visited our court. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetName] was so impressed with these foreign musicians that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has founded an institute for Funanese music near our capital city of $CAPITAL_CITY$, where Chinese musicians can study the musical styles of Funan."

 mmetr_FUN_mission_events.4.desc: "The kingdom of Funan is ruled by the Lunar dynasty, known as such due to its founding queen, Queen Soma, whose name means 'Moon' in Sanskrit as well as shares the same name as the Hindu god of the Moon. This dynasty is also known as the Naga dynasty, as the family of Queen Soma prior to her rule was known as the Naga family, named after powerful and divine serpents known as Naga.\n\nThus, just like the Lunar and Solar dynasties of the great Indian epic the Mahabharata, we people of Funan too have our own legendary royal family under which we can rally. Our grand ships shall sail under the light and guidance of the Moon, while our armies shall march forward with the ferocity and bravery of the Naga serpent."

Along with their territories we have also acquired the Cham's ships, manpower and expertise. Once unrivaled in the region, the Cham navies were especially skilled in naval warfare tactics such as conducting raids and blockades, boarding enemy ships, and even carrying out stealth tactics from the water. Thus, the ships, warriors and expertise of our former enemies of Champa shall be especially useful for achieving our maritime ambitions beyond the shores of Funan."

Besides our own mountain, we have ventured further inland along the Mekong River and subjugated various other mountains and cities across the lands of the Khmer peoples. However, our kingdom has always been a maritime polity, based around thriving port cities and overseas trade. Thus, in answering the question of governing peoples farther inland from the Mekong Delta, we may be better off granting autonomy to the inland peoples and creating loyal vassals who shall rule on the behalf of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] as well as provide tribute and soldiers to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."

Thanks to the efforts of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and the Funanese people, Vyadhapura has become a thriving center of commerce and culture visited by diplomats, merchants and travelers from across the world, a shining gem displayed for all of the world to see. Furthermore, with the urban expansion and recent population boom of this capital city, we have acquired not only prestige but also a developed center of power from which we can directly administer the surrounding lands with greater efficiently, as opposed to relying on loyal but autonomous cities and local tributaries."

While the Brahmins are by definition the priestly caste of society, their knowledge does not consist of only religious matters. Instead, the Brahmins are talented scholars well-versed in many different fields, studying statecraft, mathematics, science, philosophy, economics and literature. Thus, an individual Brahmin may be able to fill a variety of roles in our administration - thus, let us employ them in whatever focus is needed at the moment."

While we now rule over Buddhist subjects, a difference in faith does not necessarily guarantee religious conflict. The Buddhists in India have usually coexisted peacefully under Hindu rulers, and the Buddhist and Hindu faiths have several similarities and shared values. Religious authorities from both Hinduism and Buddhism have understood the other religion as merely a different way of viewing the same illusionary world. Thus, let us assure our new subjects that we shall not persecute them for their beliefs, and no harm shall be brought upon them as long as they remain loyal to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."

Having established a great kingdom of Funan stretching from the Mekong Delta to the Kra Isthmus, [Root.Monarch.Title] [Root.Monarch.GetName] is now known to all as 'Great King of Funan' in both Sanskrit as well as a variety of foreign tongues across the world. As the undisputed ruler of many, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has obtained the absolute loyalty of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] subjects and people.\n\nWith a great kingdom established along the gulf, we can now turn our attention further south to pursue greater ambitions. Although we have established a monopoly over the lucrative trade routes along the isthmus, the Malay states and their strait to the south have recently become a major trade rival to our own ports.

Intermarrying with the local Malay population, the peoples of Chi Tu formed a kingdom in their own right. Now that we have expanded our direct influence over all of the southern Malay peninsula, we have been reunited with these cousins of ours in the south. As it can be difficult to directly rule over these lands across the sea from Vyadhapura, we could establish an autonomous vassal of Chi Tu ruled by a member of our own royal dynasty."

Furthermore, we have also benefited from exchanging embassies and gifts with the Kings of Vanga.\n\nNow, we have expanded into the realm of India itself, placing the lords of Vanga and their Indian subjects under our protection. This marks a major turning point in the history of our people - our kingdom is now an empire, and our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] now holds ambitions of bringing the Kalingan homeland of our Kaundinya under Funanese protection."

Now that we have established our own great empire stretching from the fertile grounds of the Mekong River Delta all the way to the thriving port cities of Vanga, it is only fitting that our ruler [Root.Monarch.GetName] has officially adopted the prestigious title of 'Maharajadhiraja', a Sanskrit title meaning 'Great King of Kings,' one step in status above the previous title of 'Great King of Funan.' As the emperor of a new Funanese empire, we shall continue dreaming of greater ambitions until we become the Chakravartin, the sacred 'Wheel-Turning King' in Hinduism who shall be the universal ruler of all four continents in the world!"

This is especially important for realizing our future ambitions in the Middle Kingdom, as the cities of China are larger and more heavily fortified than what we have encountered in our home region. Thus, let us continue to expand our forces in our march north and seize the most opportune moment to build a great empire in China!"

Thus, one of the naval captains serving under our great [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has discovered an island in the southern waters of the Bay of Bengal that can serve as a valuable naval base from which we can launch naval invasions and raids along the Indian coastline.

Having expressed thanks to the Indian ambassador, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has declared that the horses be given the best care possible in the royal stables.

Even so, many of our cities including our own capital were sacked by the Romans, and much of our attention since then has been focused on rebuilding. While we had made peace with the Romans with terms favorable to us, our Queen Amanirenas made sure the Romans knew disrupting the peace would result in our wrath, sending an envoy to the Romans with a bundle of golden arrows along with the message: 'If you want peace, they are a token of her warmth and friendship. If you want war, you will need them.'\n\nThus, as we now wage war with the Romans, our victories on the battlefield have rallied our men to the cause as well as earned the respect of foreign polities across the land who were otherwise threatened by Roman armies.

However, through the wise rule of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] we have restored the capital city of Meroë to its former glory. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has restored the Temple of Amun in Meroë as well as constructed numerous reservoirs for storing water. With so much building underway, it would even be fair to say that this is the most prosperous period in the history of Meroë.

The kings of Kush even had to travel from Meroë to Napata upon their coronation to receive the crown from the Temple of Amun. This dynamic changed, however, when the royal family of Kush defied the powerful priests of Napata and massacred them. The burial of kings was moved to Meroë, and the situation in Napata grew even more dire during our war with the Romans, as the city was razed to the ground by the Romans.\n\nAs the city continues to be a religious center for the worship of the primary god Amun, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has made great efforts to restore the holy city and expand the Temple of Amun in Napata.

In recent generations, our royal dynasty of Kush had contended with the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt and the Roman Empire for influence over the lands of the First Cataract of the Nile River: When the Hellenistic Ptolemies ruled Egypt, the region revolted against them under the Egyptian rebel Horwennefer - though Horwennefer swore allegiance to Kush, his rebellion was eventually quashed by the Ptolemies. Two centuries later, our Queen Amanirenas led a campaign against Rome and temporarily seized the city of Aswan - while the war was ultimately inconclusive, the terms of peace were favorable to us, and the city of Aswan was placed under our authority.\n\nNow, boldened by the martial might of our own warriors and having seen the decline of the Roman Empire, we have valiantly marched even further north along the Nile, beyond the limits of the First Cataract, and now possess a gateway into the rest of Lower Egypt.

 mmetr_FAT_mission_events.1.t: "The White Banner of the Shia"
 mmetr_FAT_mission_events.1.desc: "Besides the green banner used by the Shia, the main flag used by our Fatimid Caliphate is a white banner, adopted as a contrast to the black banner of the Sunni Abbasid Caliphate. Over time, this white banner has become a symbol for all Shias in the Islamic World, both within and beyond the borders of our empire. To shield our faith, our valiant and pious soldiers shall continue to fly the white flag as we bravely stand against those who wish harm upon the Shias and the Caliph-Imam.\n\nNow that we have established ourselves as the official protector of all Shias in the world, we must consider the limitations of our state in meeting this ideological goal. Thus, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] is faced with answering the question of whether our holy war shall be led by the sword or the shield."

 mmetr_FAT_mission_events.2.desc: "The art of the Fatimid Caliphate is renonwed and admired across the world for its exquisite quality. Among the most notable of these works of art are rock crystal ewers - these ewers are pitchers that are each carved from a single block of rock crystal. These ewers are especially valuable and are decorated with birds, beasts and other motifs. Great craftsmanship is required for the creation of just a single rock crystal ewer, as a high degree of skill is required to delicately hollow out raw rock crystals without breaking it while at the same time shaping the crystal into a fine design. These ewers are thus among the most valuable gifts that we can send to our friends beyond our borders, fine symbols of both our wealth and our generosity that shall continue to aid us in currying favor with courts across the world."
 mmetr_FAT_mission_events.2.a: "Our friends shall know the opulence of the Caliphate."
 mmetr_FAT_mission_events.3.t: "The Pillars of Islam"
 mmetr_FAT_mission_events.3.desc: "The Da'a'im al-Islam, meaning the 'Pillars of Islam,' is an Isma'ili Shia book of jurisprudence written by Al-Qadi al-Nu'man, a prominent Shia jurist and official historian of the Fatimid Caliphate. Al-Nu'man himself was unparalleled by his contemporaries, becoming known as the 'Jurists of Jurists' thanks to his extraordinary insight and analysis provided through his treatises.\n\nThe Da'a'im al-Islam has since been accepted as the first official legal code of the Fatimid Caliphate, and our Caliph and the jurists and officials of the empire continue to rely on the wisdom of the Da'a'im al-Islam and the insights of al-Nu'man. As a result, the Fatimid Caliphate has been the home of many wise and learned Shia scholars who are eager to serve the Caliph."

 mmetr_FAT_mission_events.4.desc: "Since the Roman Empire, Egypt had served as the breadbasket of the Mediterranean, with grain being its primary cash crop. Since the rule of the Tulunid dynasty of Egypt, however, flax has become the main cash crop of Egypt and the Fatimid state. Flax, from which linen fibers for Fatimid textiles are made, has allowed for the expanded export of linen, a trade that now drives the entire Egyptian economy.\n\nThrough our efforts, we have expanded the centers for the production of textiles weaved from our own linens, and our entire economy as a whole has benefited from the export of these fine Fatimid textiles. With many in the Islamic World as well as the Christian lands across the Mediterranean wishing to obtain our exquisite wares, flax shall surely continue to be a lucrative market for the Caliphate."
 mmetr_FAT_mission_events.4.a: "Our Fatimid crafts are unparalleled!"
 mmetr_FAT_mission_events.5.t: "The City Victorious"
 mmetr_FAT_mission_events.5.desc: "Though we began our Caliphate with a foothold in Ifriqiyah, we have campaigned east to seize the Egyptian cities from our enemies. Now, one of the richest and most developed regions in all of the world has been captured by our Fatimid forces. To commemorate our victory, we Fatimids have founded a great city called Cairo, also known as al-Qahira, meaing 'the City Victorious,' just northeast of Fustat, the previous capital city of Egypt. Although we have only begun our rule over the Egyptian realm, both Egypt as well as our own new city of Cairo shall surely prosper under the wise rule of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] descendants."
 mmetr_FAT_mission_events.5.a: "Glory to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]!"
 mmetr_FAT_mission_events.6.t: "Great Palaces of al-Qahira"
 mmetr_FAT_mission_events.6.desc: "We Fatimids are renowned across the world for our exquisite and extravagant architectural design - our palaces are no exception. The Great Palaces of the Fatimid Caliphs is a grand and lavish palace complex in the heart of Cairo. The complex is made up of two main palaces, the Eastern Palace and the Western Palace, surrounded by gardens and squares that close the complex off from the rest of the city with nine gates. This grand complex has become known as Dar al-Khalifa, or the 'Abode of the Caliphate,' as it is not only the residence of the Caliph but also the symbolic heart of Egypt and the Caliphate itself."
 mmetr_FAT_mission_events.6.a: "The grandeur of our palaces reflects the glory of the Caliphate!"
 mmetr_FAT_mission_events.7.t: "Egyptian Administration"
 mmetr_FAT_mission_events.7.desc: "Our invasion of Egypt has concluded, and our armies are victorious. For us to realize this achievements, we spent many years planning and preparing, spreading propaganda and our Isma'ili doctrine among the Egyptian populace and stoking anti-Abbasid sentiments that allowed for the smooth conquest of key Egyptian cities. Although there are many in Egypt that were swayed to our side long before our conquest of Egypt thanks to our extensive spy networks, stability is not guaranteed.\n\nMany of the Egyptian elite are surely wary of any changes implemented by our regime - thus, we have allowed the local elites and personnel from the previous regime to remain in place under the supervision of a Fatimid vizier. We have also set up weekly sessions in the mazalim court to listen to and address the weekly grievances of the local populace.\n\nAs a result of these efforts, we have succeeded in gaining the trust of the Egyptian people. With trust now earned, we can pursue more ambitious administrative policies in Egypt."

 mmetr_FAT_mission_events.8.desc: "With the holy cities of Mecca and Medina under our control, we have appointed a new Emir of Mecca from a sharifian dynasty, a new Sharif descended from the family of the Prophet Muhammad. With the Sharif answering directly to us Fatimids, with ourselves direct descendants of Fatima and Ali, we have united the holiest cities in all of Islam under the rule of a Shia Caliphate. Besides the religious and political benefits that come with controlling these cities, we shall also have greater control over the pilgrimage economy, thus benefiting our treasury through earning a cut of what the Sharifate collects in Mecca and Medina."
 mmetr_FAT_mission_events.8.a: "Any pious pilgrims shall never face harm under our protection."
 mmetr_FAT_mission_events.9.t: "Governors of Aleppo and Damascus"
 mmetr_FAT_mission_events.9.desc: "Although we established Fatimid control over Syria, most notably the key cities of Damascus and Aleppo in which we have appointed governors to rule on our behalf, the region has been all but loyal to our Caliph. Several governors had the insolence to betray us in favor of our enemies in Constantoniple and Baghdad, and several local ruling tribes in Syria and Palestine have rebelled against our rule.\n\nThus, we have exerted greater direct control over the region, removing disloyal princely clans and appointing Fatimid governors in their place. With the lands of Syria fully subjugated by our victorious armies, there are few subjects of the Caliph remaining who possess the impudence to defy us in the future."
 mmetr_FAT_mission_events.9.a: "All who defy us shall face only swift retribution."
 mmetr_FAT_mission_events.10.t: "Patronage of Bayt al-Maqdis"
 mmetr_FAT_mission_events.10.desc: "One of the names of the city of Jerusalem is Bayt al-Maqdis, meaning 'Holy House,' a name historically used in reference to the Temple of Jerusalem. While the Umayyads were quite interested in Jerusalem, with the Dome of the Rock being one of several significant landmarks built by the Umayyads, the city of Jerusalem was largely neglected by the Abbasids.\n\nAlthough we initially left Jerusalem largely untouched as well, in part due to our focus being mostly on Egypt and with the matter of building and developing Cairo, the consolidation of our rule in Egypt has afforded us some time and manpower for the renovation and development of Jerusalem. As a holy city of Jews, Christians and Muslims alike, the expansion of Jerusalem under our rule has won us the favor of all of the People of the Book who live in the Levant. Still, our resources are ultimately finite, so we must decide on which demographic we shall dedicate more attention to."

 mmetr_FAT_mission_events.11.desc: "With few options for alliances with other states in the Muslim world, we have turned instead to the Nubian king of Makuria for friendship. It is said that the best of relationships are ones that are mutually beneficial to all parties, and our friendship with the Nubian ruler is certainly the case. While we export important goods such as wheat, wine and linen to the Nubians, in turn we continue to import ivory, livestock and slaves from the Nubians.\n\nAs we continue to expand, we find it increasingly difficult to rely on the Kutama Berbers who have historically served as the backbone of our Fatimid armies. Thus, many of these imported slaves from the south are given arms and placed in our armies to bolster our ranks, with now both Nubian and Turkish slave soldiers fighting side-by-side for our holy cause."
 mmetr_FAT_mission_events.11.a: "Our two states shall remain friends for generations."
 mmetr_FAT_mission_events.12.t: "Kutama Recruitment"
 mmetr_FAT_mission_events.12.desc: "Our Fatimid army was initially fielded by the Kutama Berbers, the same Kutama that had converted to Isma'ili Shia Islam and supported our founder, Caliph al-Mahdi Billah. It is even said that God has granted the Kutama pre-eminence among other peoples of the region, as the Kutama were the very first to see and accept the truth, becoming the first followers of our Caliphate.\n\nAmong the Kutama, the four sub-tribes of the Jimala, Lahisa, Malusa and Ijjana possess the most authority. Thus, we primarily recruit from these tribes when we wish to bolster our ranks, as no matter how far we campaign from the Kutama homeland of Kabylia, we can always rely on the Kutama to support us."
 mmetr_FAT_mission_events.12.a: "We need a leader to supervise our armies."

 mmetr_FAT_mission_events.13.desc: "The defeat of the Umayyads through the conquest of their historic capital of Qurtuba is not only a military and political victory. While the Umayyads were a temporal rival of our Caliphate, as the Umayyads were led by a false Caliph who clashed with our true Caliph over influence in the Maghreb, they were also rivals of religious significance.\n\nIt was the Umayyad dynasty who was responsible for the death of Husayn ibn Ali at the Battle of Karbala, a martyrdom that shall never be forgetten by us Shia Muslims. Thus, with the capture of the Umayyad city of Qurtuba, we have been given the opportunity to lead a great revolution to oppose oppression and tyranny, just as Husayn ibn Ali had done many generations ago."

 mmetr_FAT_mission_events.14.desc: "With the total and complete conquest of the islands of Sicily and Malta, our Caliphate has established itself as the dominant naval force in the waters of southern Italy. Even the mighty Byzantine fleet could not stand in the face of our naval tactics during their defense of Sicily.\n\nAt the Battle of the Straits, our navy employed the use of Greek fire to significant effect. Divers from our ships swam towards the enemy fleet and fastened ropes to the rudders of the Byzantine ships, and earthenware pots filled with Greek fire were then rolled along these ropes to collide with the Byzantine vessels, destroying many of their ships and resulting in a major victory for our forces. With such devastating results, it would be foolish of us if we did not continue using this gift from the Greeks against them."

 mmetr_FAT_mission_events.15.desc: "With the subjugation of all of Yemen under Fatimid rule, we have established our own da'i, or 'leader,' in Yemen. This da'i shall rule on our behalf, and his dynasty shall continue to bring stability and prosperity to the peoples and lands of Yemen.\n\nWith Yemen quelled, we have now tapped into the lucrative trade networks of south Arabia, with our merchants now openly trading with India and beyond through Yemeni ports, exporting both Egyptian and Yemeni goods to faraway lands."

 mmetr_FAT_mission_events.16.desc: "Ever since we Fatimids established a foothold in Ifriqiyah, before we even held Egypt, the Fatimid Caliphs all held greater ambitions of one day seizing Baghdad, the capital of the false Caliphs of the Abbasid dynasty. Now, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] as at long last realized the dreams of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] forefathers by capturing the city.\n\nWhile our revolution has finally reached the lands of Iraq, it would be foolish of us to immediately begin compelling the majority-Sunni populace to change their doctrines immediately. Thus, we are pursuing a gradual policy of conversion while at the same time tolerating doctrinal differences, the same tolerance that we practiced in Ifriqiyah and Egypt in the past."
 mmetr_FAT_mission_events.16.a: "We shall bring the Revolution to the rest of the Islamic world!"
 mmetr_FAT_mission_events.17.t: "Christian Cities of the Romans"
 mmetr_FAT_mission_events.17.desc: "There is a significant population of Christians that have lived under our rule for quite some time in Egypt and Syria. However, these Christians were are relative minority compared to the Sunni Muslims that made up most of the regional population. Now, as we push the Romans further back into Anatolia, we are conquering lands that are majority Christian, a new dynamic that our Caliphate now faces. Although we have promoted tolerance of all faiths in the past, we also have our goal of fulfilling the revolution begun by our forefathers through spreading the Da'wa, or the doctrine of the Shiite Fatimid Caliphate, throughout the world."
 mmetr_FAT_mission_events.17.a: "We shall not pressure them with conversion."

 mmetr_FAT_mission_events.18.desc: "The City of the World's Desire has fallen at last to the martial might of the Fatimid Caliphate. While our Umayyad rivals in the past had tried and failed to seize the city, we have successfully laid siege to Constantinople, and our Caliph [Root.Monarch.GetName] has now entered the city followed by [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] victorious army.\n\nWhile the city of Constantinople has great political, strategic and economic significance thanks to its geographical location and naturally-defensible position, there is much more religious and symbolic significance to the city. Having been the capital of the Roman emperors for centuries, Constantinople was the center of Eastern Orthodox Christianity and contains numerous religious treasures and relics within its walls."

Then, our goal was to spread the Da'wa, or doctrine of Isma'ili Shia Islam among the followers of God - this, we too, have accomplished. With the Muslim lands of Persia, Iraq, Syria, Egypt all converted to the true doctrine, we can now continue our holy war beyond the Islamic World and export the revolution to new reaches of the world!"

 mmetr_FAT_mission_events.20.desc: "The Qarmatians ruled over vast, lucrative fruit and grain estates run by tens of thousands of slaves from Ethiopia. With the lands of the Qarmatians now under our rule, our export economy has expanded in size and scope. Although the question of how we should manage the estates has been settled, answering the question of what shall become of the Qarmatians is more difficult.\n\nAlthough they were Isma'ili Shias like us, the Qarmatians rejected our Imam-Caliph and called him a false imam, a grave insult to the true Imam-Caliph and thus to God Himself. The Qarmatians raided our lands and remained a thorn in our sides for generations. At the same time, they are Isma'ili Shias like us, and perhaps we wish to set a benevolent example for our future subjects - or, we could make the Qarmatians servile workers of their own former estates and treat them with contempt."
 mmetr_FAT_mission_events.20.a: "They shall suffer the consequences of their actions!"

 mmetr_FAT_mission_events.21.t: "The Fatimid Cities of Ifriqiyah"
 mmetr_FAT_mission_events.21.desc: "Our Caliphate was established in Ifriqiyah - thus, several key cities were expanded upon or founded by the Fatimid Caliphate in the region. Two of these cities built by us are Mahdia, named after our great founder Caliph al-Mahdi Billah, and El-Mansuriya. Our patronage of El-Mansuriya has been so effective that the city has eclipsed the long-thriving city of Kairouan, which was once the capital of the Aghlabid dynasty that was overthrown by our founder Caliph al-Mahdi Billah.\n\nBesides the impressive stature and prosperity of the cities themselves, these regional capitals of ours are also home to splendid Fatimid palaces. Fatimid arts and architecture are renowned across the world, and these great Fatimid palaces are likely the greatest architectural achievements of our entire empire. Let us continue to sponsor the development of these cities so we may display the wealth and prosperity of our empire and show all that our Caliph is backed by God."

As our victorious armies entered and paraded through the city of Rome, it is understandable that the Christian inhabitants of the Catholic capital of Rome could not help but feel fear over their uncertain fates under our Caliphate, even if we have been quite tolerant of the Christians and other People of the Book who live in our lands. Thus, let us make it clear to the Christians of Italy and Pope himself of what our plans are in regards to Christianity in Italy."

However, the matter of administration in regard to such a large amount of land overseas is not an easy matter to address. Thus, there are many in our court who have proposed the idea of reorganizing our various vassals in Italy into a new title, the Emir of Italiya.\n\nWith the Emirate established, we would be able to entrust governance of Italy to an Emir who shall be loyal to our Caliph and our cause. To prevent the Emir from growing too powerful, however, we must consider how much land we wish to grant to the Emir of Italiya, or if we should grant any at all."

Although we have continued to emphasize our Alid descent and thus legitimacy to rule as Caliphs, the successors to the Prophet Muhammad, many of our rivals and non-believers refuse to refer to us as the Alid dynasty.

As a result, many of the cities of Epirus such as Arta and Ioannina became destinations for thousands of Greek refugees who fled the domains of our empire following the Fourth Crusade.

Demetrio Progoni, the Prince of the Albanians and ruler of the Principality of Arbanon, had converted to Catholicism and made it a state religion, though he did so partly due to being threatened by Venice, as he feared Venice would claim its nominal lands in Albania from him.\n\nWith Roman Catholicism restored in Albania, perhaps the time has come to restore the Principality of Albania under a Catholic prince. We must also carefully consider our own political situation and stability, as granting only the lands immediately surrounding the religious and political center of Durrës as opposed to all of the Albanian lands may be a wiser move."

The formidable Seljuk Sultan of Rûm has been soundly defeated, and even now we make preparations for continuing the offensive to retake all of Asia Minor for the banner of Christendom.\n\nBefore we expand further into our historical Rhomanian claims in eastern inland Asia Minor, however, we must first decide how we should integrate our new Turkish and Muslim subjects. While we previously had to deal with a religious divide between two doctrines of Christianity, the Roman Catholic ruling class of the empire and the Greek Eastern Orthodox populace, we are now faced with followers of a religion not within the realm of Christendom. Therefore, we must answer the same question that the Crusader states of the Levant answered over a century ago."

 mmetr_LAT_mission_events.10.desc: "Though the so-called 'empire' of Trebizond held only a small strip of land along the northern coast of Anatolia, they were able to amass a great amount of wealth thanks to the trade that passes through Trebizond, known in Latin as Trapezus. The city was the destination of many Muslim traders who shipped goods such as Byzantine silk from Greece as well as goods from the Black Sea to the Muslim countries east of Asia Minor, and taxes were levied on all of these fine goods. With the city of Trebizond under our control, these benefits now belong to the Empire of Constantinople."

 mmetr_LAT_mission_events.11.desc: "While we initially rejected the Greek administrators of the Byzantine Empire, we cannot rule an empire without integrating its subjects. In consideration of our situation, we have invited several skilled Greek talents to our court so they may assist us in bringing stability and prosperity to our Empire of Constantinople. We have identified the three most enthusiastic of these talents who may prove the most loyal to our cause."

 mmetr_LAT_mission_events.12.desc: "When we inherited the lands of the former Byzantine Empire, we were faced with an economic crisis - we had dismantled the economic administration of the Greeks, which resulted in the disruption of trade and production in our empire. While the peoples of our empire faced a dire food shortage, we implemented major changes and invested in the agricultural development of the land. Thanks to our efforts, we have cultivated an abundance of foodstuffs that can supply our armies as well as prevent our cities from being starved out during sieges."

 mmetr_LAT_mission_events.13.t: "Renovatio Imperii Romanorum"
 mmetr_LAT_mission_events.13.desc: "Since the partition of the former Byzantine Empire in the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade, our empire was intended to be the successor to the Greek Empire of the Byzantines, and our Emperors were to be successors of the Byzantine Emperors. However, we faced numerous obstacles such as the insolent rump states of the Greeks of Nicaea as well as the Seljuk Turks of Rum and the Tsar of Bulgaria. In the face of such obstacles, we have emerged victorious, with Asia Minor now under the firm control of Constantinople. Having done what not even the Byzatines could achieve in centuries, we now have the legitimacy and support from the Papacy to declare a proper Latin Empire in the east."

 mmetr_LAT_mission_events.14.desc: "The Hagia Sophia is the most prominent church of the Greek Orthodox Christians, with its construction having began since the days of Constantine the Great and his son Constantius II. The church has since seen numerous changes, expansions and renovations, with the most recent structure being build by Emperor Justinian the Great. The Hagia Sophia has been further damaged since Justinian, with earthquakes and other natural wear-and-tear causing cracks in the main dome and other areas of the church.\n\nThus, we had taken it upon ourselves to restore the Hagia Sophia to its former glory, arguably perhaps even greater than before. At the same time, however, we can take it one step further - just as Constantine had removed the pagan statues from the ancient pagan temple that the Hagia Sophia was built upon, we could choose to remove all Orthodox traces of the Hagia Sophia and fully convert it into a Christian church. Or, we could keep the Orthodox aspects of the church so that the Hagia Sophia may be a shared space of worship for both Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Christians alike, which would also mean continued Orthodox pilgrims arriving in Constantinople."

 mmetr_LAT_mission_events.15.desc: "In the initial period following the foundation of our Empire of Constantinople, our economic condition was so dire that we resorted to selling relics and other religious treasures stored in Constantinople and Greece to make ends meet. Now that we have stabilized our realm and have earned great prestige, we can now continue selling relics without seriously impacting our reputation. On the other hand, holding on to these treasures would prove to our peoples as well as other states that we have come far since our troubles of the past."

They have each individually established their base of operations, and as a result have become prominent religious members of our society. While they initially arrived for the purpose of aiding our crusade and cause, the orders have offered to permanently assist us as state-sponsored local officials in Constantinople. While doing so would benefit us in many ways, it would also give them greater access in our state affairs."

However, in Anno Domini 1187 the city fell to the Saracen forces of Saladin; the King of Jerusalem, unable to retaliate, was left without the its namesake city, and many lost hope that the Holy Land would ever be retaken.\n\nWith the expanded power and territory of our empire, however, our Empire of Constantinople finally achieved the military capacity and strength for retaking and defending the Holy Land and the city of Jerusalem. Thus, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has become one of few men in our time who can call themselves the Defender of Jerusalem."

After the schism, however, the Patriarch of Constantinople became affiliated with the Eastern Orthodox Church. Since the conquest of Constantinople under the Catholic banner during the Fourth Crusade, we have worked hard to reestablish ties between the cities of Rome and Constantinople.\n\nWith the foundations laid in place, we put in place the new Latin Patriarch of Constantinople, officially recognized by the Papacy and replacing the Eastern Orthodox Patriarch. As the political custodians of the city of Constantinople and thus the new Latin Patriarch, we have benefited greatly from the reunion of the two Roman cities."
 mmetr_LAT_mission_events.18.a: "Rome and Constantinople shall never be divided again."

 mmetr_LAT_mission_events.19.desc: "Since Anno Domini 1054, the Great Schism divided the majority of Christians between Roman Catholics in the west and Eastern Orthodox Christians in the east. Multiple efforts have been made by both parties throughout the years to reconcile the two doctrines and reunite Christianity under a single doctrine - the First Crusade itself had been initiated in part to promote cooperation and eventual unification of the two sides.\n\nThrough a great deal of effort, we have achieved the union of the Christians of the east with those of the west, reuniting the devout followers of Christ under the Catholic doctrine of Rome. This is a tremendous achievement never before seen in the history of Christianity itself, and as a result our state, peoples and [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] have earned great respect from the Papacy and all of Christendom."

Although the Tibetan Empire had proven themselves equals of the Tang on the battlefield, our warriors of Nanzhao have successfully driven the Tibetans back. Furthermore, we have captured several key Tibetan cities as well as thousands of Tibetan soldiers, at least of thousand of which are willing to serve in our military as new subjects of the Zhao.\n\nHaving successfully established a firm foothold in the mountains of Tibet, we now have the position as well as experience in mountainous warfare to launch a grander campaign deeper into the lands of Tibet so we may bring our former overlords to their knees before our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."

Though their kings had challenged our authority, we have proven to all of their peoples that we are not to be defied. Having fully consolidated our position in the region of Miandian to the south, we have gained the fealty of the various cities that once thrived just south of our homeland. With so many cities now under our control, we have expanded our methods of extracting tribute and soldiers across a greater expanse of land.\n\nWhile the peoples of these city-states now serve under the common banner of the Zhao, we also all follow the teachings of Lord Buddha.

Following the Southern Campaigns of the famed Zhuge Liang of Shu Han, our ancestors of the Cuan family rose to prominence as local administrators and nobility on behalf of the imperial family of Shu Han. However, the Cuan were defeated by the Sui dynasty and split into the White Mywa and Black Mywa who govern our state today.\n\nAlthough it has been many centuries and generations since the times of the Cuan clan, we have successfully upheld the prestigious legacy of our ancestors by capturing the city of Chengdu, the major stronghold of Jiannan under the Tang as well as the former capital of the Shu Han dynasty that our Cuan ancestors had served. Chengdu has served as the capital of many emperors and kings in history - thus, perhaps it would be wise for us to relocated our capital to Chengdu, from which we can more easily administer our new domains in Jiannan.

When we Black and White Mywa of the southern Zhao states initially united, our forefathers could only dream of ruling an autonomous kingdom powerful enough to fend off its neighbors, the powerful Tang and Tibetan Empires. However, we have now achieved such strength, and gained such favor from Heaven, that our forces have even vanquished these powerful forces while on the offensive, seizing the grand capital of Chang'an from the Son of Heaven himself.\n\nWith the conquest of Chang'an, we now have access to new treasures as well as construction materials and monuments that we could bring back to our capital so we may create our own city eclipsing Chang'an in splendor. At the same time, however, the people of Chang'an have been instrumental, having defected to our forces during the Siege of Chang'an and allowing us to capture the city.

While we could play the role of benevolent liberators and treat our new Viet subjects with magnanimity, the Viet lands are home to productive rice fields that are especially valuable to a growing kingdom.

We have seized the Mandate of Heaven from those who have lost Heaven's favor, and our Emperor [Root.Monarch.GetName] has officially become the one and only Son of Heaven in the universe.

With the unprecedented expansion of both our Zunbil dynasty as well as the true faith of Zun, we have truly established an empire worthy of the Great Zun.\n\nThanks to the blessings we have received from Zun, we now have the opportunity to honor Zun and display our piety by declaring an Empire that belongs only to Zun - rather than being rulers of a temporal empire, our Zunbil dynasty could instead rule simply on behalf of the Great Zun, the true ruler of the Empire of Zun!"

 mmetr_RUM_mission_events.1.desc: "The port city of Alaiye has been the target of attacks and raids from our ambitious neighbors, including both Muslim generals and Christian crusaders. However, our enemies have been repelled from the city every time without fail. Due to its strategic position along the southern coast of Anatolia, we have invested much time and coin into its development. It is therefore relieving to see that we have successfully transformed the port city into a self-sufficient city-state that can defend and govern itself on behalf of the Seljuk Sultans of Rûm."

 mmetr_RUM_mission_events.2.desc: "When the authority of the Great Seljuk dynasty in Persia collapsed, a number of atabegs west of the Persian heartland declared independence, establishing their own dynasties as emirs. Men of both local ethnicities as well as of Oghuz Turkic origin became rulers of their own realms, with the Zengid dynasty being a notable case of the latter group of emirs established in the wake of the Khwarezmid and Ayyubid incursions that drove the Seljuks into decline.\n\nAfter several grand campaigns, our great [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has subjugated these former atabeg dynasties, placing the emirs under the direct authority of Rûm. Like many other cases, conquest is only half of the equation - we must now determine how we shall integrate these local emirate dynasties. Do we wish to integrate their dynasties as autonomous emirs, or do we wish to uproot these emirs from their domains and appoint Rûmi governors in their place?"
 mmetr_RUM_mission_events.2.a: "Grant the former emirs autonomy in exchange for their loyalty."

 mmetr_RUM_mission_events.3.desc: "Ever since the Armenians established their own independent principality and later kingdom in Cilicia, the ruling Armenian dynasts benefited greatly from the coastal emporia, or trade cities, in Cilicia. The cities' merchants possessed trade networks linking Asia and Europe, sitting at a crossroads of the spice trade between the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean Sea. The Armenians secured many trade agreements with the merchant cities of southern and western Europe, and the Armenian Cilician economy thrived.\n\nWith these very cities now under our control, the merchant class of Cilicia have mostly accepted our suzerainty and now work towards our own interests. While many Armenian families have decided to remain in Cilicia under our rule, thousands of wealthy Armenians have fled from Cilicia and settled in Cyprus. We have also heard that a number of Armenians have also fled elsewhere to other regions across Europe to the west. This is of no worries to us, as we can nonetheless profit from their former cities' wealth without their help."

As the Greeks still have significant influence in our land, culture and administration, the Greek aristocracy became part of the Seljuk nobility, retaining their noble status under new suzerains. Now that we have officially accepted the Greek peoples as equal subjects of Rûm, we can further integrate the Greeks into our faith and culture, starting with the nobility."

Furthermore, the medreseler are attracting wise Islamic scholars from across the Islamic community and the world at large, and they also serve as intellectual centers for other subjects besides theology and faith such as medicine, mathematics and alchemy.\n\nThese projects are also part of our own Seljuk heritage - the very first of these medreseler were built by a Seljuk vizier, Nizam al-Mulk, in the lands of the Great Seljuks during the Seljuk dynasty's peak in Persia.

Thus, we have achieved what the great empires of history have been unable to accomplish - the City of the World's Desire is now ours.\n\nOf course, Constantinople is often seen as the center of the Eastern Roman civilization itself, and it would be politically and strategically advantageous should we move our royal capital to the great city. On the other hand, we have already worked hard to develop [Root.Capital.GetName], and there are a few courtiers of the Sultan who wish to keep [Root.Capital.GetName] as the Sultan's capital.

Furthermore, large numbers of Han Chinese also settled in Southern Xiongnu lands, and tensions were high between the Xiongnu and the Han settlers.\n\nWith the lands of the Southern Xiongnu now under our control, we now also rule over the various Han settlers that chose to stay rather than flee upon our arrival.

Geumwa had Yuhwa locked in a room - in the room, however, the sunlight followed Yuhwa wherever she walked, and she eventually gave birth to a large egg.

This boy would become known as Chumo, a nickname that described skilled archers. Chumo was placed in charge of the horses by Geumwa; Chumo intentionally fed the fastest horses the least food.

Thus, we have the option of either inviting these wise and pious monks to the capital or allowing them to continue their good work spreading the name and word of God in the countryside."
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.1.a: "Welcome his counsel in the court."
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.1.b: "A learned monk is best for missionary work."
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.2.t: "Saint Andreas the Apostle"
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.2.desc: "Although we Roman Emperors have lost temporal influence over the far reaches of the Christian world with the collapse of Roman authority in western Europe as well as the loss of Syria, Egypt and Africa to the Islamic invasions, the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople still possess great influence as the richest and most presitious center of all of Christendom.\n\nThe Patriarch is successor to Saint Andreas the Apostle, also known as Andrew, one of the Twelve Apostles chosen by Jesus Christ. Andreas and his brother Peter were both originally fishermen by trade when Jesus Christ approached them, calling upon them to be Fisher of Men, meaning those who bring men to the Church and Jesus Christ. While Peter went on to found the Church in Rome, Andreas founded the Church in Constantinople. Thus, we are inextricably tied to a great and holy mission ordained by our Lord Jesus Christ."
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.2.a: "Let us continue his legacy as Fishers of Men."
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.3.t: "University of Constantinople"
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.3.desc: "The University of Constantinople, founded in 425 AD by Emperor Theodosius II, continues to educate its scholars with a diverse range of topics such as law, medicine, arithmetic, rhetoric, astronomy and philosophy, including the centuries-long traditions of Platonism and Aristotelianism. Besides the old university, other intellectual institutions are also thriving as a result of our investments, attracting many scholars and men of faith thanks to our capital's opulence and prestige.\n\nThe Monastery of Stoudios in Constantinople is a notable example, as the Stoudites have been celebrated for their prestigious calligraphy and manuscripts alongside their monastic duties. Thus, the City of the World's Desire has truly become a center for not only commerce and faith, but also culture and education."
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.3.a: "May these talented scholars enrich our empire for posterity."
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.4.t: "Cultivation of Prosperity"
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.4.desc: "Thanks to our efforts of establishing farms and storehouses across the empire, we have experienced a recent agricultural surplus that will allow to further develop our lands and feed our troops. Furthermore, the resettlement, colonization and agricultural development of previously-empty or abandoned lands within our borders has stabilized demographic growth in our empire."
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.4.a: "Bread and prosperity for all Romans!"
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.5.t: "Theodosian Walls of Constantinople"
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.5.desc: "The city of Constantinople is surrounded and protected by several impenetrable walls, the most notable of these the double line of the Theodosian Walls, build during the reign of Theodosius II. Since the reign of Constantine the Great and the construction of the first great walls of Constantinople, the City of the World's Desire has never fallen to any foreign invader.\n\nAfter the latest series of renovations, additions and restorations regarding the Walls of Constantinople, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] now looks upon [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] achievement with great confidence and satisfaction, for [Root.Monarch.GetName] knows that these walls shall not fall within [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] lifetime, nor during the lives of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] children and grandchildren."
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.5.a: "The new Walls of [Root.Monarch.GetName] shall stand strong for eternity!"
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.6.t: "Ambitions Beyond Anatolia"
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.6.desc: "Since the Arab invasions we have been on the defensive, scrambling our troops and resources in our attempts to maintain control of Anatolia as farther reaches of the empire fell to foreign invaders, whether they be the Arab or the Slavic armies. As a result, we found it necessary to consolidate our position in Anatolia, establishing kleisoura, frontier districts separate from our themata, for the purpose of defense.\n\nNow that Anatolia is secure, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] can now look beyond its frontiers. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has recently been hard at work preparing for further campaigns into Syria, a land once firmly under Roman control. Thus, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has laid claim to Antiocheia, the former administrative capital of the Roman province of Syria I.\n\nBefore it fell to the Arab invaders, we Romans held the city for centuries, ever since we took it from the city's founders, the Seleukid Empire. Let us secure Antioch and its surrounding cities once more so we may once again establish a Roman province in Syria."
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.6.a: "All of Syria shall be ours again!"
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.7.t: "Reconquest of Syria"
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.7.desc: "With the reconquest of Syria, we have finally avenged the fallen Roman troops of the Battle of Yarmuk as well as reclaimed the seat of one of the Patriarch of Antioch, one of the five original patriarchs of the Pentarchy. With the lands now secured by Byzantine armies, our administrators have been focused on integrating these reclaimed territories into our empire.\n\nNot only have we placed a doux, or military regent, in charge of Syria as a new and proper theme of the Roman Empire, but we have also established in Antioch the office known as the Domestic of the Schools of the Orient, the supreme commander of the imperial forces on the eastern frontier. With an empowered commander in charge in the east, we will be able to more efficiently manage our troops at the frontier while also more efficiently funding the governance of these lands through the theme system."
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.7.a: "Syria shall never again fall to our enemies."
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.8.t: "The Patriarch of Jerusalem Restored"
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.8.desc: "With the reconquest of the holy land of Jerusalem, we have not only restored ourselves as the defenders of the True Cross but also the Patriarch of Jerusalem. Just as Emperor Heraclius had retaken the True Cross from the Sassanids before the city of Jerusalem was lost to the Caliphs, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has retaken the city along with the relics of the Cross still located in Jerusalem.\n\nWhile the Patriarch of Jerusalem had possessed a high degree of power separate from Constantinople thanks to the longstanding sanctity of the city of Jerusalem, the Patriarch of Jerusalem is now in the debt of Constantinople, and thus the Patriarch shall surely act in accordance with the interests of the Patriarch of Constantinople as our trustworthy ally in faith in the east. With the Patriarchates of Jerusalem and Antioch now firmly under our control, we now look towards restoring the last Patriarch in the east, the Patriarch of Alexandreia."
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.8.a: "Alexandreia shall be liberated!"
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.9.t: "Triumph in Baghdad"
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.9.desc: "It has been long since our Emperors have held a great triumph. What better occasion for a triumph is there than the conquest of Mesopotamia, a land not subdued by Romans since the reign of Trajan, and a land in which we have not witnessed any Roman victories since the Battle of Nineveh under Heraclius. With the Arab city of Baghdad now under our control, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] now parades throughout the city in triumph, and the state has commissioned works and monuments comparing [Root.Monarch.GetName] to the great Emperor Trajan."
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.9.a: "We truly have a new Optimus of Rome!"
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.10.t: "Courtiers of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.10.desc: "The ability for men of talent to ascend to great heights has always been a core value of Rome since its very foundation under Romulus himself. Thus, we have implemented a system of court titles granted to various dignities, including titles with and without temporal power. As a result, we have a thriving civil aristocracy that fills the ranks of our growing bureaucracy.\n\nHowever, the civil aristocracy continue to face pushback from the inherited aristocracy, the nobles whose families have served in high positions for countless generations. Furthermore, the eunuchs have begun to acquire more positions of power, with the holder of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s purse and thus entrusted with administrative and financial affairs, the sakellarios, being an office held by eunuchs.\n\nThus, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] must be wise in who [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] chooses to place [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] full faith in."
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.10.a: "Promote those who earn privilege through service."

 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.11.t: "The Question of Dalmatia"
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.11.desc: "In the 7th century AD, Dalmatia was stolen from Roman hands by invading Slav and Avar armies. With Dalmatia fully reconquered under the martial might of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], various new peoples such as the Slavs are now direct subjects to the Roman [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\n\nSeveral noblemen in our empire have offered to lead the Roman population in resettling and romanizing the region. On the other hand, there are some who believe that a more hands-off approach with our frontier territories, with autonomous foederati, would be less costly and more efficient for defending the core of the empire from external threats."
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.11.a: "Promote resettlment of Romans as well as romanization of the peoples in Dalmatia."
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.11.b: "Conscript the clans of Dalmatia to fight for us as local foederati."
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.11.c: "Allow the Dalmatians to levy their own armies as an autonomous foederatus."
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.11.tt: "Release a §YMarch§! of §MDalmatia§! in all §Ydirectly-owned§! provinces in the §OCroatia§!, §OBosnia§! and §ODalmatia§! areas."
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.12.t: "A New Patriarch of Rome?"
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.12.desc: "The religious and temporal schism between Constantinople and Rome had allowed the Bishop of Rome to make ecclesiastical decisions without consulting our own Patriarch in Constantinople. With the city of Rome now reclaimed, the schism has been mended between our two cities - mending the generations-long schism in lands beyond the twin cities, however, will require much more work.\n\nUnlike the Pentarchy before the fall of the Western Roman Empire, we in Constantinople now have the option to keeping the new Patriarchate of Rome on a tight leash as an ecclesiastical puppet, to ensure that no such heretical schisms or declarations shall occur in our western territories ever again. However, returning autonomy to the Patriarchate of Rome may also win us some favors with not only the Patriarch but also the local peoples of Italy who only recently came to terms with the schism's conclusion in our favor."
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.12.a: "An obedient Patriarch in Rome shall maintain our interests in the west."

 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.13.desc: "Just as Julius Caesar had made a great gamble upon crossing the Rubicon, declaring civil war against the senators of Rome and Pompey, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has decided to take the gamble for restoring Gaul under the Roman banner. While we do not have the same legitimacy to retake Gaul as we did centuries ago, our officials have forged documents claiming several Roman-founded cities as our own. While these claims shall surely not last, we must act quickly if we wish to capture them while we have the military might to back our claims, for even those most skeptical of our claims can be silenced for a short while by the might of Rome."

 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.14.desc: "Our generations-long struggle with the khans of Bulgaria have at last come to an end, with the Bulgarians as well as the tribes and polities of Thrace and Dacia now under our control. With the Bulgarians now truly humbled, we have avenged the countless Roman deaths by their hands. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has therefore been granted the title 'The Victorious' by the Roman nobles and dignitaries for vanquishing our foes and restoring security and stability to the Thracian heartland."

 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.15.desc: "The lands and crown of Armenia have long been contested between the Roman Empire and their rivals in the east, whether they be the Parthians, the Sassanids or the Arab Caliphates. With the lands of Armenia and Georgia under our control once more, we are now faced with the question of how we wish to rule over these new frontier lands."
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.15.a: "Grant them an expanded domain over Armenia and Georgia."

 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.16.t: "The Nestorian Question"
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.16.desc: "The followers of the doctrine of Nestorius were among the many heresies that splintered from the true doctrine of Christianity heralded by the Church in Constantinople. The Nestorians had since established a wide presence in Mesopotamia and Persia and greatly expanded their church under the Persian Empire. With Mesopotamia now under the control of the Roman Empire, we are faced with the question of how we wish to deal with, or reconcile with, the heretics that had fled from our lands."
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.16.a: "There is no such thing as compromise in absolute faith."
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.16.b: "We must compromise with the heretics of our new domains."

 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.17.desc: "While the lands we have been conquering thus far - Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and the Levant - have been regions that were once under firm Christian control, we have now conquered deep into Arabia, a land in which Christianity had never taken hold on a large scale. With the heartland of the Islamic faith itself now under our control, we must proceed with caution and faith when answering the question of how we should integrate our new Muslim subjects."
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.17.a: "Stability and loyalty must be ensured before proselytization."
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.17.b: "We cannot delay until all follow the true doctrine under God."
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.18.t: "Answering the Iconoclast Controversy"
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.18.desc: "The controversy of iconoclasm, the destruction of icons, has been hotly debated within our empire. The iconoclasts favor the destruction of icons, believing the physical depiction of Jesus Christ and the saints to be heretical. On the other hand, those who are against iconoclasm argue that this is not the case, and this iconophile stance is supported by the Roman upper class as well as Christians beyond our borders in the west, including the Bishop in Rome."
 mmetr_BYZ_mission_events.18.a: "Our faith dictates that all icons must be destroyed."

With calls from the mother country to mobilize our troops in this war, we will need to win over even those reluctant to fight for a war they may see as pointless. Thus, how should we frame this war in our official declarations?"

As our colony continues to prosper, we shall attract more talent of our own culture from the mother country who wish to climb the ranks and feed their families back home.\n\nHowever, we also have the option to open up high ranking positions such as those within the Governor's Council to individuals of talent living in, or even born in, the mother colony.

 mmetr_Generic_Germanic_mission_events.1.desc: "As our vassals fight with us on the battlefield against our enemies, a sense of unity has naturally been fostered between our vassal tribes and our own [Root.GetAdjective] people. The Germanic tribes have confederated over time thanks to internal factors and external threats, a similar development to our own. Thus, with our vassals identifying more and more with the war banners of [Root.GetName], we have the choice of either promoting further confederation and eventual integration of these vassals or allowing our vassals to retain autonomy as long as they continue to support us in military affairs."

 mmetr_Generic_Germanic_mission_events.2.t: "Wild Boar's Head Formation"
 mmetr_Generic_Germanic_mission_events.2.desc: "The majority of Germanic armies are made up of infantry, fighting on foot in tight formations. One of these formations is the wedge, also known to us as the 'Keil,' or 'wild boar's head.' The Keil is a trapezoid-shaped formation which allows a band of warriors to pierce and shatter enemy formations on foot. The wedge also places our chief and the most skilled and heavily armored warriors at the front.\n\nThe Keil is strong on all sides, which has allowed us to split apart the formations of even the Roman legions. On the other hand, the Keil can be as devastating to the user as it can be to the enemy - an army using the wedge would be at risk of total annihilation in the event of a retreat, since the collapse of the front would break the entire Keil wedge formation. Fortunately for us, this means that our loyal warriors will be bound by their oath and follow their chief in the vanguard to either victory or death."
