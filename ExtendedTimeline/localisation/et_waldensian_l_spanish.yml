 waldensian: "Waldensian"
 waldensian_religion_desc: "Waldensianism is a Christian denomination that originated in Lyon and Lombardy in the 12th century. They are also known as "The Poor of Lyon" or "The Poor of Lombardy". The people of the Waldensian faith live in voluntary poverty and lack of possessions. While the Lyonese believers were living off of donations and self-sufficient work only, the Lombardian followers of the faith also allowed paid work in work communes in order to earn money to afford live. The Waldensian faith rejects the idea of purgatory, indulgence and worship of saints and relics, as well as wealth of the Church in general. They also didn't support child babtism, because they wanted the baptised to actively accept it. While the Waldensians did accept the Church hiearchy to some degree, they were highly in favor of having lay priests and everyone doing personal bible studies."

 # Events:
 et_waldensian_events.EVTNAME1: "Emergence of Waldensianism"
 et_waldensian_events.EVTDESC1: "A recently emerged Christian movement known as Waldensianism has been gaining followers among the common folk in some of our provinces. The followers reject the idea of indulgence, purgatory, the worshipping of saints and relics. They also denounce the wealth of the Church and volunteer for a life in poverty. The established Christian churches have denounced Waldensianism as heretical."
 et_waldensian_events1.EVTOPT1: "We need to stop them."
 et_waldensian_events1.EVTOPT2: "It's not our business."

 et_waldensian_events.EVTNAME2: "Spread of Waldensianism"
 et_waldensian_events.EVTDESC2: "Waldensianism is slowly spreading in [Root.GetName] through its followers. Waldensianism does not only denounce wealth, especially within the Church, but also regularly organizes food for the poor. Furthermore it makes use of lay priests. Those particularities help them spreading among the peasantry."
 et_waldensian_events2.EVTOPT1: "Worrisome."
 et_waldensian_events2.EVTOPT2: "Wonderful."

 et_waldensian_events.EVTNAME4: "Personal Bible Studies of [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 et_waldensian_events.EVTDESC4: "Personal bible studies being an important part of the Waldensian faith, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] was asked by close members of the clergy, when [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will consider doing personal bible studies [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself]."
 et_waldensian_events4.EVTOPT1: "I will use a lot of time for personal bible studies."
 et_waldensian_events4.EVTOPT2: "I will use a moderate amount of time for personal bible studies."
 et_waldensian_events4.EVTOPT3: "I will do personal bible studies, but not too much."
 et_waldensian_events4.EVTOPT4: "I don't have time for this."

 et_waldensian_events.EVTNAME5: "Progress in Personal Bible Studies"
 et_waldensian_events.EVTDESC5: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] has decided to invest time into personal bible studies. The more [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] reads the bible, the more [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] understands the messages of God and Jesus."
 et_waldensian_events5.EVTOPT1: "Very Good."

 et_waldensian_events.EVTNAME6: "Unsatisfactory Personal Bible Studies"
 et_waldensian_events.EVTDESC6: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] has decided to invest time into personal bible studies. However [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has reached a point, where [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] just cannot understand the meaning of certain texts. What should [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] do?"
 et_waldensian_events6.EVTOPT1: "I must focus more or ask for help. There is much more to learn."
 et_waldensian_events6.EVTOPT2: "I think I studied long enough anyway."

 et_waldensian_events.EVTNAME7: "Increase in Lay Priests"
 et_waldensian_events.EVTDESC7: "A core part of the Waldensian faith is the usage of lay priests. They have a better connection to the peasants and thus can easier convert them than some expensive clergymen. \nThis year it seems there are even more lay priests preaching the word of God to the heretics and heathens in and close to our realm than in the years before."
 et_waldensian_events7.EVTOPT1: "We should take advantage of that."
 et_waldensian_events7.EVTOPT2: "Perhaps they can be of use, we'll see."

 et_waldensian_events.EVTNAME8: "Terrible Living Conditions for the Poor"
 et_waldensian_events.EVTDESC8: "The Waldensian faith demands living in poverty and lack of possessions. However this doesn't mean people are supposed to starve, they just shouldn't live in wealth and only have what they need. It seems the situation in [target_province.GetName] has gotten out of control, we have to do something."
 et_waldensian_events8.EVTOPT1: "We need to help the poor in [target_province.GetName]."
 et_waldensian_events8.EVTOPT2: "Maybe the people of [target_province.GetName] are just too used to unholy wealth?"

 et_waldensian_events.EVTNAME9: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] lives in Unholy Wealth"
 et_waldensian_events.EVTDESC9: "The [Root.GetAdjective] people have noticed the enormous amount of money and luxury the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has hoarded at [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] court in [Root.Capital.GetName]. They certainly aren't happy about that, given that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] should be a role model and, just like them, live in apostolic poverty."
 et_waldensian_events9.EVTOPT1: "I only need the money to be able to donate!"
 et_waldensian_events9.EVTOPT2: "That's no unholy wealth, it's what I need!"
 et_waldensian_events9.EVTOPT3: "Running the state may require a bit more wealth than what the common people need."
