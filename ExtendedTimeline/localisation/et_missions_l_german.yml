Alternatively, Baekje could be approached, and given support against Mokji so that our nations could split Mahan between us. Finally, there’s the option of a Japanese ally, made easier by the cultural similarities which remain between our peoples."

Each of the original twelve had from 600-5000 families, but those in newly conquered Byeonhan are generally smaller, and none of the statelets except Saro are as developed as we would like.

This system will simply not do with the rapid changes in society, including rapid urbanisation and increased use of iron weapons and armour. It is vital that we create a conscript force, similar to the Chinese, and institute standard training and drill.

From a loose confederation of fifty four different statelets of up to ten thousand families each, we have become a more traditional kingdom divided between just two power centres: Baekje and Mokji. We can try to resist these changes, remaining a tribal confederation and preventing a rift from forming with the northern states around Baekje, however to do so would bring terrible consequences, and likely consign us to a footnote in history."

 han_vs_han_jin_desc:0 "With the Samhan united once more we should turn our attention to the Chinese in the north of the country. With the fall of Wiman Joseon, the Han set up four Commanderies on its former territory; Lelang, Lintun, Xuantu, and Zhenfan. We should conquer all of them, justifying our expansion as a restoration of Gojoseon under the rule of the many Gojoseon refugees that fled to our lands."

Buyeo has become a valuable ally for the Chinese as a buffer state against the Xianbei, and their continued independence prevents our nation from expanding further into the mainland. When they fall, however, we shall have formed a true kingdom of the Dongyi, united under a single banner."

Now that the Chinese are our subjects, bringing a decisive conclusion to this long war is our responsibility. The experience of the Buyeo against the Xianbei and their similar style of warfare will be invaluable in this, as will the liannu crossbow, invented during the Warring States period, and highly effective against the Xiongnu cavalry. The whole Xiongnu empire must be brought to heel so that their raiders can never threaten us again."

Called Wokou, Wako or Waegu, they strike from bases found on the many islets between our lands and the main Wa islands.

 southern_honshu_jin_desc:0 "Southern Honshu is home to two major kingdoms: Izumo, the land of bronze and silver; and Kibi, a prosperous realm of many temples and shrines. These kingdoms remain largely independent of the Yamato, but they’re powerful in their own right, and if the Yamato are able to centralise the country under their rule, it may become very difficult to dislodge them."

The Yamato kingdom is already the strongest Yayoi state, and their wealthy lands are defended by mountains. The Yamato Kingdom is largely feudal, with chiefs appointed or recognised by the Tenno. In order to take over the kingdom, all of these chiefs and officials will have to be brought to heel individually."

Historically, they remained a threat until 811, and the last tribes were only brought under imperial control in the 11th century. The Emishi are renowned horse archers and raiders, and will remain a problem for our Japanese holdings until they’re made to submit."
 hokkaido_jin_title:0 "Hokkaido"
 hokkaido_jin_desc:0 "Starting in the Muromachi period, Japan would become progressively more involved with the Ainu as a result of settlements founded by refugees on the Oshima peninsula. We find ourselves in a similar position as our conquered enemies, the Emishi especially, have built up settlements on Hokkaido. The Ainu possess little besides fish and furs, but they’ve been adept at bringing us into their own conflicts as we generally support them against the Emishi newcomers. This involvement, and the frequent raids by Emishi on northern Honshu, are quickly becoming more expensive than full occupation would be, and so we should launch a campaign to take the whole island."

 king_kings_jin_desc:0 "While we are adopting many customs from the Chinese and from other Korean states, the traditional way of ruling for the Jin has always been as kings of kings, heads of great confederations united by personal or tribal loyalty. Perhaps this is not a system which should be discarded lightly, especially as our empire grows and we bring more and more peoples under our banner. Direct rule from the capital is not always practical, and loyal client states can sometimes be more useful than additional citizens."

 shikoku_jin_desc:0 "Named for its four regions, Shikoku is an agricultural island well known for its citrus fruits. It is not a particularly militarily useful place, but it would be wise to conquer it to prevent it from becoming a refuge for those who seek to fight against our rule, and the longer we delay in taking it, the more difficult it will be to prevent attacks on the rest of our Japanese holdings launched from Shikoku."
