 hellenic_flavor.1.d:0 "Based on Roman Mythology, the twin brothers Romulus and Remus were born by the joining of their mother, Rhea Silvia, and the god Mars. After their birth, they were forcefully abandoned by the king Amulius in the Tiber river. Through a series of miraculous interventions, the river carried them to a she-wolf and woodpecker who nurtured them until they were taken in by a shepherd and his wife. Once the boys reached maturity, they learned of their origins, killed Amulius, and went on to found a new city. The two brothers quarrelled over the location until Remus was killed. The city of Rome was then created, named after Romulus, on the 21st of April 753BC. Now, the one thousand year anniversary of the founding of Rome has dawned upon us, and the nation celebrates its long history."

In fact, sacrifices to household deities were common and included giving up things such as fruits, wheat, honey, wine incense, or even food that fell off the dinner table. The most potent sacrifices involved animals. They were first cleansed and then calmed due to the fact that tradition stated that the harmonisation of the earthly and divine was necessary. In other words, the animal needed to willingly offer its life and remain calm throughout its death. There were also recorded instances of human sacrifice during the early period of the Roman Republic, but this practice was officially ruled as murder in 81BC."

They held immense power in the Roman world, allowing for the pardon of Caeser when he was an enemy of the state. The Vestal had to remain virgins for once they accepted the responsibility of their role, they were considered daughters of the state.

They were exempt from military service and taxes and had the power to excommunicate anyone from social festivals and such. Pomponius Mela claimes that druids carried out their rituals in secret caves and trained by memorizing hundreds of verses by heart.

He is said to be the grandson of heaven and to have founded the kingdom in 2333BC. Legend has it that Dagun's grandfather, Hwanin, Lord of Heaven, allowed his son, Hwanung, to live with 3000 followers on Paektu Mountain, founding the City of God. There Hwanung tought humans many things about art, medicine, and agriculture including acupuncture and moxibustion. When Dagun ascended the throne, he founded the walled city of Asadal located near Pyongyang. With this, the Gojoseon Kingdom was founded and would last for over two centuries, until the fall of Wanggeom in 108BC. Now, our state has both Mount Paektu and the historic area of Asadal and with this we can reminisce about the founding of the first Korean State."

She killed her husband and with the God of spring dead, the world's vegetation dies and the cold seeps in uniformity. Morana then dies at the end of the year. This cycle repeats itself year after year and was used to explain the change in seasons. Now, we should choose which God we would support more.

Through their work they influenced the cultural development of all Slavs, for which they received the title Apostles to the Slavs. They are credited with devising the Glagolitic alphabet, the first alphabet used to transcribe Old Church Slavonic.

The city was considered a holy site in which both Egyptian and Nubian deities were worshiped and was believed to be the place where the ancient Egyptian deity Amun was born. Likewise, Jebel Barkal served as the burial gounds for many of the Nubian Kings. Now, the once proud city of Napata has begun to crumble.

Atenism was distinct from other religions nearby in that it was Henotheistic. In other words, Aten was treated as the supreme God, yet the other Egyptian deities were considered sub gods. Amenhotep IV changed his name to Akhenaten and his capital to the newly created Akhetaten. Atenism believed that the sun-disk God Aten was the giver of all life, and through him all things are connected. Unfortunately, this heresy did not last long as after Akhenaten's death, the religion faded away and the court moved to another city. Due to the recent conquest of Akhetaten, interest has piqued about this old heresy. Now the decision rests in the hands of our King, whether to reinstate Atenism, or ignore it."

Egyptian oracles are known mainly from the New Kingdom and afterward, though they probably appeared much earlier. People of all classes, including the king, asked questions of oracles, and, especially in the late New Kingdom their answers could be used to settle legal disputes or inform royal decisions. The most common means of consulting an oracle was to pose a question to the divine image while it was being carried in a festival procession, and interpret an answer from the barque's movements. Other methods included interpreting the behavior of cult animals, drawing lots, or consulting statues through which a priest apparently spoke. The means of discerning the god's will gave great influence to the priests who spoke and interpreted the god's message."
