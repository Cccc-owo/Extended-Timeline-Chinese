 pillage_lands_desc:0 "As a barbarian tribe, much of our lands are not under our direct control but instead a typical raiding target of ours that we safeguard as our own. It is time to embark on a raid, and accrue more glory for [Root.GetName]!"

 barbarian.1.t:0 "Our Tribe is not glorious!"
 barbarian.1.d:0 "We have failed to uphold the ancient traditions of our people, and our tribe feels as though it is the laughingstock of [Root.Capital.GetRegionName]. A Charismatic noble has risen up from amongst them, and is openly challenging our rule! We must crush him if we are to continue chasing our ambitions."
 barbarian.1.a:0 "We Ride to battle!"
 barbarian.2.t:0 "Exceptional Games Held"
 barbarian.2.d:0 "Due to our high prestige, the stability of the realm, or our wonderful reputation, the games we have held have gone much better than usual. We now reap the benefits of our hard work!"
 barbarian.2.a:0 "Splendid"
 barbarian.3.t:0 "Pillaged Province Revolts!"
 barbarian.3.d:0 "My Liege! Your advisor rushes into your line of view. Our typical pillaging of a local province has not gone to plan. They are in open arms against us! It seems that our treatment of our people has not gone over as well as we have thought. They wish to defect to a nearby neighbor, as they feel they will be better protected there. We managed to put down the initial uprising, but we fear they shall return. How shall we proceed?"
 barbarian.3.a:0 "Alas, we must send out the troops."
 barbarian.4.t:0 "Civilization Gives Benefits"
 barbarian.4.d:0 "Our efforts to settle and civilize our tribe have not gone unrewarded. Our nation is learning about many new techniques that will assist on the battlefield and off, and support us in our rise to power as a result. This has lead to new ideas funneling into our population country and speeding up technological development. Of course, we could redirect this power into the cities themselves, to increase our overall prosperity."
 
 barbarian.4.a:0 "Funnel it to the cities"
 barbarian.4.b:0 "Let it be free across our nation"
 barbarian.4.c:0 "Actually, I have a better idea..."

 barbaian_civil_ally:0 "One of our allies has long ago abandoned their barbaric ways and is encouraging us to do the same."
 barbarian.5.t:0 "Civil Ally encourages settlement"
 barbarian.5.d:0 "One of our allies, who has long since settled down and forgone barbaric ways, has sent an ambassador to encourage us to do the same. Doing so would closen ties between us, as well as improve our standing with other civilized nations. However, we could also reject, reinforcing our raiding ways much to the delight of our subjects."
 barbarian.5.a:0 "Let us work to bring [Root.GetName] into the world's stage"

 barbarian.6.t:0 "A truly feared tribe"
 
 barbarian.6.d:0 "As our tribe campaigns around [Root.Capital.GetRegionName], accruing glory for ourselves, it has become clear that [Root.GetName] is the one to fear, and to beat. Our neighbors are conspiring against us, while some of them are in awe and some of them are in fear. We could affirm our strength here, and go forth and claim a glorious empire! However, that is not without risks. Another, safer option would be to use our power to strongarm some of our neighbors into becoming our subjects, although this would be to the defecit of our prestige. We could also back down entirely, and attempt to make concessions to the nations damaged by our conquests. This would look good diplomatically, but hurt our prestige within the tribe."
 barbarian.6.a:0 "We shall never back down! [Root.GetName] is the rightful owner of [Root.Capital.GetRegionName]!"
 barbarian.6.b:0 "We can use this position to strongarm our neighbors"
 barbarian.6.c:0 "Now is not a time to cause more hardship."
 barbarian.7.t:0 "High glory attracts settlers"
 barbarian.7.d:0 "Due to our recent campaigns and celebrations, our high glory has attracted quite a crew of settlers. Mostly warriors, they come to serve the Great [Root.GetName]. Of course, we have quite the sway over who stays and who goes. We could encourage settlers to increase the prosperity of our cities, or we could encourage more warriors to migrate and handpick the best amongst them to lead our armies."
 barbarian.7.a:0 "We must handpick warriors to assist our conquests"
 barbarian.7.b:0 "It would be best to encourage people to settle down in [Root.GetName]"

 free_raids_barbarians:0 "Freedom To Raid"
 free_raids_barbarians_desc:0 "If we grant our warriors autonomous rights in raiding our neighbors, we can passively accrue more glory for ourselves without burdening the nation. This will, of course, mean our neighbors dislike us a bit more, but more glory for [Root.GetName] is always worth it!"

 barbarian.9.d:0 "A petition from the warriors of our nation has come to your attention. It appears they are quite unhappy with the reforms you have been passing, and would like to ensure the protection of the raiding ways they hold dear. Of course, they do not know what is best for them. But it may be in our interests to avoid conflict with our tribal leaders."

 barbarian.10.t:0 "Barbarian Code"
 barbarian.10.d:0 "The time has come for us to re-organize the code of living that all barbarians in our realm live under. By refocusing our efforts, we can increase our output. The Tribal Leaders suggest that we should focus on accruing glory for [Root.GetName], and seek to support an increased amount of raids and pillages. The Merchants, on the other hand, think it would be wise to go against tradition and encourage a more centralized and civil model. Of course, we could also give free reign to the factions, allowing them to do as they please."
 barbarian.10.a:0 "Let us go forth and conquer! Glory to [Root.GetName]!"
 barbarian.10.b:0 "A more civil route would be wise."
 barbarian.10.c:0 "Let us loosen the reigns and differ to our loyal factions."

 barbarian_always_war:0 "Encourage Constant War"
 barbarian_always_war_desc:0 "We can promise to our raiders that we will be in a state of constant war, ensuring they always have targets. This will improve support amongst our population, but also make it harder to maintain glory during long periods of peace, and will increase our barbarity as a whole."

 barbarian.11.d:0 "As a barbarian tribe, war is central to our identity. But how we should go about war has become something of a debate as of late. While we have always pillaged and razed, new elements suggest that a more civil approach should be taken, to keep our administrative problems to a minimum."
 barbarian.11.a:0 "We shall show the enemy no quarter!"
 barbarian.11.b:0 "They are right, it is time to focus on more civilized warfare."
