Some of the rebels joined Muawiya precisely because they thought Ali's followers would end up dominating the Caliphate, but by rallying their armies against the Caliphate they are sealing that fate themselves as only those loyal to Ali remain on our side. With this, the Caliphate will be dominated by Ali's dynasty long into the future even if the position of Caliph will still remain nominally elective. The Sunnis who oppose the dominance of Ali' followers have thus been declared heretical."
