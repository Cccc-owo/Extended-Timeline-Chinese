 triremeDESCR:0 "The trireme was an ancient vessel and a type of galley. It derives its name from its three rows of oars, manned with one man per oar."
 troopship:0 "Troopship"
 troopshipDESCR:0 "A troopship is a ship used to carry soldiers, either in peacetime or wartime. Operationally, troopships are normal ships, and unlike landing ships, cannot land troops directly on shore."
 war_galley:0 "War Galley"
 war_galleyDESCR:0 "The galley was primarily propelled by oars, usually about 25 pairs manned by up to three men each. This meant that they were less dependent on wind gauge compared to sailing ships, and their maneuverability made them a feared adversary. Eventually, the galley went out of regular use with the introduction of more advanced oceangoing men-of-war, but remained useful in shallow waters until the 18th century."
 fiat3000:0 "Fiat 3000"
 fiat3000DESCR:0 "Based largely on the French Renault Light Tank, the Fiat 3000 was the first tank to be produced in series in Italy. It was known to have a largely inadequate offensive capacity, its machine guns were not powerful enough to take on other tanks. Nonetheless, the tank had more machine guns than many tanks, and as such was quite effective defensively when fighting infantry."
 carro_armato_p2640:0 "Carro Armato P 26/40"
 carro_armato_p2640DESCR:0 "Armed with a 75mm gun and an 8mm Breda machine gun, plus another optional machine gun in an anti-aircraft mount. The designation P stands for 'pesante', meaning 'heavy' in Italian. The Carro Armato P 26/40 was known for its reliable suspension, and good power-to-weight ratio."
 comitatenses:0 "Comitatenses"
 comitatensesDESCR:0 "The Comitatenses were the mobile armies of the Late Roman Empire, originally created to prevent usurpers from rising up in revolt, but later taking on the role of defeating the confederations of barbarians. They operated in legions of 1000 men, and were the equivalent of the old Roman legionnaires in quality and discipline, even if their practices and equipment were different."
 limitanei:0 "Limitanei"
 limitaneiDESCR:0 "Limitanei were the backbone of the new frontier system in 324. Trained and equipped essentially the same as their Comitatenses counterparts, the difference was that Comitatenses had more priveleges and tax reductions than the Limitanei. While the Comitatenses focused on supressing usurpers, and the occasional gigantic barbarian confederation, the Limitanei did the majority of the Empire's defense, constantly defeating raids and making preemptive strikes into Germania, as well as defending forts and towns along the frontiers."
 equites_promoti:0 "Equites Promoti"
 equites_promotiDESCR:0 "Equites Promoti were first created from the Legionary cavalry units under Gallenius in 268, and were organized in units of 360 men. The Equites Promoti were lancers, trained to strike at the opportune moment in the battle, or drive away enemy cavalry. They were not supposed to go head-to-head with infantry like the comitatenses, but could hold their own if they had to."
 equites_scutarii:0 "Equites Scutarii"
 equites_scutariiDESCR:0 "Equites Scutarii played a slightly different role than their Promoti counterparts, using light javelins, a sword, and a large shield rather than the lance. Their job focused more on screening duties and defending the flanks of the Roman formation, rather than striking at weak points in the enemy. They also served well to drive off barbarian cavalry or intercept raiders, as well as guide and control the nomads who moved their herds from the summer to winter pastures."
 auxilia_palatina:0 "Auxilia Palatina"
 auxilia_palatinaDESCR:0 "The Auxilia Palatina were the elite units of the Roman army, that under generals like Aetius and Stilicho, faithfully tried to control the federates and preserve the western half of the Roman Empire. They were well paid, well equipped, and very disciplined, and many would later end up on the payroll of Aetius as Bucellarii, after the loss of north Africa in 439. The Palatina remained in service until the death of Aetius in 454, and were replaced by foederati."
 unnigardae:0 "Unnigardae"
 unnigardaeDESCR:0 "The Unnigardae was a word mixed between Latin and Gothic, and meant 'Hunnic Guards.' The Unnigardae are Bucellarii, units hired and paid and equipped by a Roman general, rather than Foederati who are paid by the state. The Huns would play a key role in the Roman Empire, especially under Aetius, and would introduce Lance-and-Bow tactics to the Roman cavalry."
 foederati:0 "Foederati"
 foederatiDESCR:0 "Foederati were barbarians recruited under treaty, and led by their own officers, to fight for the Roman army. After the army effectively deserted in 455, the only replacement was the Foederati, which the Emperor Majorian won the loyalty of and quickly found great success in Gaul and Spain in his plan to cross the Gibraltar straits to Africa. The Foederati, after Majorian's death, took control of the Empire, beginning to appoint their own Emperors, and eventually would depose the last Roman Emperor in 476."
 arithmoi:0 "Arithmoi"
 arithmoiDESCR:0 "The Arithmos was the Greek term in this era for the old Roman Numerus, or 'regiment'. The Arithmoi were small regiments of Limitanei and Comitatenses that now formed the bulk of the Roman troops, alongside their Cavalry complement and Foederati Allies. Although not elite troops, these main-line infantry could hold the line and take on almost any opponent they faced."
 optimates:0 "Optimates"
 optimatesDESCR:0 "The Optimates were an elite cataphract guard unit that were classified as 'Klibanophoroi' or Clibanarii, because they had fully armored horses and riders. They became very notable after their creation under Maurice and would later form part of the Imperial Tagmata. The Optimates used maces, lances, and bows, taking the tactics of Bucellarii and bringing them to the Thematic army."
 akritai:0 "Akritai"
 akritaiDESCR:0 "Akritai were the frontier troops of the Thematic armies and were responsible, like the Limitanei before them, to repel small raids from the Arabs and later on the Turks. Unlike their limitanei predecessors, the Akritai's income was supplemented with land they lived on and maintained. Armed with light javelins, a large shield, and a sword, the Akritai were fairly close in armament to the Late Roman Army, and although not as well trained as the earlier Limitanei, did their job well."
 hippo_akontistai:0 "Hippo Akontistai"
 hippo_akontistaiDESCR:0 "The Hippo Akontistai were mounted Akontistai, or skirmishers, who used large numbers of light javelins to perform skirmishing, scouting, and other duties. Faster and more mobile than the Akritai or infantry Akontistai, they were geared towards rapid intercepts of Arab or Turkish raiders. Like the Akritai, they lived on land grants and were also supplemented with pay."
 skoutatoi:0 "Skoutatoi"
 skoutatoiDESCR:0 "Beginning in the 9th Century, the Romans began reconquering the lands taken from them, and at the head of these reconquests were the Skoutatoi, main-line Roman infantry from the Thematic armies. The Skoutatoi were professional soldiers, and essentially the successors of the Roman Comitatenses of old. The Skoutatoi's job was to hold the line for the cavalry to make the decisive strike in the battle, but were also capable of winning a battle on their own."
 hippo_toxotai:0 "Hippo Toxotai"
 hippo_toxotaiDESCR:0 "Hippo Toxotai were horse-archers that used Lance-and-Bow warfare against their enemies, and thanks to the Avars were now equipped with Stirrups and more powerful Turkish bows. With new tactics, organization, and equipment, the Roman Thematic Army became the most efficient and effective army in the Medieval Era, and the Hippo-Toxotai usually made the decisive strikes in any battle, with tactics derived from Maurice's Strategikon."
 skholai:0 "Skholai"
 skholaiDESCR:0 "Established from the old Schola Palatina units, the Skholai were the Kataphraktoi of the Tagmatic army, using their heavy armor and lance-and-bow warfare to defeat enemy cavalry and strike enemy infantry. The Skholai were often recruited from the aristocracy, and were professional troops and the most senior unit in the Tagmatic field army."
 pronoiarioi:0 "Pronoiarioi"
 pronoiarioiDESCR:0 "The Pronoiars were men granted land and fiscal responsibility in exchange for providing troops when called upon. Essentially, they made up the Roman feudal system. The Pronoiars were formalized by Alexios Komnenos as a result of the collapse of the Anatolian theme system and a new method was needed for the Empire's administrative management and defense. Pronoiars fought on both foot and horse, depending on how much they could afford, but much of their equipment was still standardized and provided by the Roman state."
 archontopoulai:0 "Archontopoulai"
 archontopoulaiDESCR:0 "The Archontopoulai were an elite cataphract guard created by Alexios Komnenos, who recruited teenage orphans and trained them for years to become Kataphraktoi. Armed with lances, fully armored horses and riders, and bows, they were often used in his campaigns and could be a decisive factor in battle. With the support of the Varangians, Pronoiarioi, and the remaining Tagmatic units, they made for a winning combination in the 11th and 12th centuries."
 mourtatoi:0 "Mourtatoi"
 mourtatoiDESCR:0 "The Mourtatoi were a unit of Roman guard archers recruited from the Turkomans and Turkomens, as well as the various Beyliks, in Anatolia. The Mourtatoi guard were one of several guard units that included the Paramonai and Varangioi, which formed the core of the drastically reduced Roman army. The Mourtatoi were foot archers, armed with Turkish Bows, Armor, and Paramenion Sabres. They proved invaluable, faithfully fighting to their deaths against the Ottomans in 1453."
 paramonai:0 "Paramonai"
 paramonaiDESCR:0 "The Paramonai were the Greek guard, one of the few units actually comprised of Greek recruits, rather than mercenaries. They were effectively heavy infantry and heavy cavalry, and were a sort of backbone to the other mercenary and militia troops the Empire used at the time. The Paramonai seem to have been disbanded with the loss of the Greek provinces in the mid-1300s."
 kavalarioi:0 "Kavalarioi"
 kavalarioiDESCR:0 "Kavalarioi were medium cavalry in use since the early theme system and would survive as a unit until the time of the fall of Trapezounta in 1461. They were armored lancers who took the place of the old Kataphraktoi, whose tactics were becoming outdated. More maneuverable than heavy armored cataphracts, they would exploit openings in the battle line or drive away enemy cavalry, as well as generally defend the flanks of the formation."
 allagion:0 "Allagion"
 allagionDESCR:0 "With the restoration of Constantinople the Roman Army once more had a core of professional soldiers. However, the gains in the Balkans were offset by losses in Anatolia, in the end resulting in continuing decline. The new organization of Roman Skoutatoi into Allagia was more effective than the old Moira. These men were heavy infantry whose manpower was supplied by the Pronoiarioi, and were equipped with armor, swords, and large shields in the traditional manner of the Skoutatoi."
 skythikon:0 "Skythikon"
 skythikonDESCR:0 "The 14th century, with the coming and collapse of the Mongols, saw the return of 'Scythian' cavalry in Roman service, recruited from the Blue Horde and Golden Horde. Mongol, Cuman, and Pecheneg mercenaries helped the Romans fight the Turks in Anatolia, and probably carried gunpowder into Europe through the Turks and the Romans. Their methods were effective, but eventually the Romans lost the income to keep recruiting them and they became outmatched by Ottoman infantry archer tactics."
 latinikon:0 "Latinikon"
 latinikonDESCR:0 "The Romans continued to fight against the Ottomans well into the 15th century, using Italian and Germanic mercenaries called Latinikon. The Latinikon were armed with contemporary Italian equipment supplied by the Roman allies of Venice and Genoa, which usually was a full hooded suit of chainmail, a leather jacket, and a Celata helmet, with large triangular shields and spears and swords. The Latinikon rarely fought in open battle, with notable exceptions being the campaign of 1444 where the Romans reconquered up to Athens, before being driven back to the Hexamilion and defeated. Better equipped and trained than their Ottoman opponents, the Latinikon fought to the end at Constantinople in 1453."
 stratioitai:0 "Stratioitai"
 stratioitaiDESCR:0 "Stratiotai is the Greek word for 'soldier' and these men were mounted Latinikon armed with Paramenion Sabres and full suits of mail, recruited from noble families settled by the Venetians throughout the Balkans. Although in the early 15th century they all went into service of the Romans, later on they would continue to fight the Turks in the name of Venice until the late 16th century, and most of their noble lines survive until the modern day."
 heriban:0 "Heriban"
 heribanDESCR:0 "A heriban was a levy of Germani militia, who would be armed primarily with spears and shields, and other than that had to provide their own equipment. They were usually zealous individuals intent on defending their homes, but had little training or experience in warfare. However, they could be relied upon to execute effective ambushes and hold the line, when necessary."
 hridriskara:0 "Hridriskara"
 hridriskaraDESCR:0 "Hridriskara were Germanic cavalry skirmishers, armed with shields and javelins. Their horses were usually stunted ploughorses, and they made for agile raiders and good skirmishers on the battlefield. Like their infantry counterparts, they had little training, little experience, and had to provide their own equipment."
 alemanne:0 "Alemanne"
 alemanneDESCR:0 "As agricultural techniques improved, so did trade with the Romans and the quality of living. This process began about 150 AD and allowed Germanic Soldiers to afford more equipment and training, hence the Alemanne. Although still militia, the Alemanne was a slightly better organization that was used by the various Suebic groups, including the Alemanni, Marcomanni, and Quaddi. Due to agricultural improvements these men could campaign longer and their raids were more successful."
 chnite:0 "Chnite"
 chniteDESCR:0 "Chnite were germanic lancers, armed usually with a spear and shield, and whatever else they could afford. Although militia, they were more effective at engaging enemy cavalry than their Hridiriskara counterparts, and adopted some of their tactics from the Sarmatian Roxolani and Iazyges to their East. The Chnite would eventually become the origin of the term 'Knight' as many of these men were low-ranking chieftains or those landlords under the chieftain's influence."
 89chiro:0 "Type 89 I-Go"
 89chiroDESCR:0 "Weighing 12.8 tons, with three machine guns and strong and light steel plate. The Type 89 design was completed in April 1929, with production starting in 1931, making this the first tank to be mass-produced in Japan. The Type 89 had two variants - the Ko ('A') version, which used a water-cooled gasoline engine, and the Otsu ('B') version, with an air-cooled diesel engine and improved frontal armor."
 type62:0 "Norinco Type 62"
 type62DESCR:0 "Designed for use in the difficult terrain of Southern China, the Type 62 was created with mountains, hills and lakes in mind, and so has an advantage over many other tanks in these areas. Armed with a main gun plus three machine guns, the Type 62 is nonetheless quite light. The tank loses weight by being small and having thinner armour than many other tanks."
 type90:0 "Type 90 Kyu-maru"
 type90DESCR:0 "The Type 90 Kyu-maru is the current main battle tank of the Japanese army. Entering service in 1990, the Type 90 Kyu-maru achieves manpower savings by reducing the crew to three through the development of the turret bustle autoloader. This design allows the tank crew to operate without a loader, which allows the use of a smaller turret."
 pugnarii:0 "Pugnarii"
 pugnariiDESCR:0 "Barbarian troops had almost always fallen to the heavily armed and armoured legionaires in the past, but now manpower was desperately short in the Western Empire. The solution was to mix the forces of Foederati with native, heavier Roman troops in the same division. The Roman troops made up the backbone of these forces, and received special training in working with the Foederati. Such armies were called simply 'Pugnarii' meaning 'fists' or 'fighters', and maintained the power of old legions while keeping the numbers needed to fight the barbarians."
 novaetestudo:0 "Novae Testudo"
 novaetestudoDESCR:0 "With the Medieval Warm Period comes increased crop yields and thus increased population. With the increases in population the Empire is once again able to field its traditional heavy infantry which was so effective in the past and which is vital against the worsening viking menace."
 graeciprocur:0 "Graeci Procursatoribus"
 graeciprocurDESCR:0 "Roman battles were fought on two fronts at this point, one front in Greece, the other in Gaul and Germania. While the heavy Roman troops that had been the mainstay of Roman armies since the foundation of the Empire were highly effective in the relatively flat terrain of Gaul and Germania, in the rough terrain of Greece they were much less effective. Local skirmishers were thus used by the Romans for any campaigns in Greece."
 ascensoreshun:0 "Ascensores Hun"
 ascensoreshunDESCR:0 "The 'Hunnic riders' were in fact not Huns at all, the real Huns having been beaten back centuries ago. These riders nonetheless continued the Hunnic horse-bow strategy, which was extremely effective against the once more dominantly infantry-based enemies of Rome."
