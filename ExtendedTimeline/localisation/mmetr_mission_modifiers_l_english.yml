As medicine, silphium is used to treat many different illnesses and symptoms such as cough, sore throat, fever, indigestion, aches and pains, warts and inflammation - it is even used as a contraceptive and an aphrodisiac. The seed of silphium itself is in the shape of a heart, becoming a Greek symbol of love. Although access to silphium has become scarce over the generations, our efforts of developing the lands of Cyrenaica have provided new seedbeds from which we can produce the herb."
