 cpbm_cathar.EVTNAME4:0 "Pelican Spotted!"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTDESC4:0 "In the midst of a religious ceremony, a majestic pelican appeared on the threshold of the church. The pelican is a very important symbol for Cathars. Indeed, in their scriptures, Jesus is compared to a 'pelican as bright as the Sun'. As a consequence, the sight of this bird reassures the faithful, who believe that the Lord is still watching over them."
 cpbm_cathar.EVTOPT4:0 "Fantastic!"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTNAME5:0 "Receiving the Consolamentum"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTDESC5:0 "Perfects, or Perfecti, are Cathar monks who were expected to follow a lifestyle of extreme austerity and renunciation of the world, which included abstaining from eating meat and avoiding all sexual contact. By that virtue they were recognized as spiritualized angels by their followers. As such, one of their main roles was to administer the Consolamentum to the dying. However, this sacrament could also be given to the living. The oldest Perfect of the realm came to us, offering his services to administer the Consolamentum to you. By receiving this sacrament, you will also become a Perfect, meaning that the chances to have an heir will be lowered. But in return, you might receive some valuable knowledge from the Heavens."
 cpbm_cathar.EVTOPT5A:0 "Accept the offer"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTOPT5B:0 "Politely decline the offer"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTNAME6:0 "Redeeming Knowledge for Administration"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTDESC6:0 "While the Consolamentum is ending, you feel a soft warmth around you. For a moment, some of your faithful followers are even sure to see you crowned with a divine light. When you regain consciousness, you have many new ideas to improve the administration of your nation."
 cpbm_cathar.EVTOPT6:0 "The Consolamentum was a good idea, after all."
 cpbm_cathar.EVTNAME7:0 "Redeeming Knowledge for Diplomacy"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTDESC7:0 "While the Consolamentum is ending, you feel a soft warmth around you. For a moment, some of your faithful followers are even sure to see you crowned with a divine light. When you regain consciousness, you have many new ideas to improve the diplomacy of your nation."
 cpbm_cathar.EVTOPT7:0 "The Consolamentum was a good idea, after all."
 cpbm_cathar.EVTNAME8:0 "Redeeming Knowledge for Military"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTDESC8:0 "While the Consolamentum is ending, you feel a soft warmth around you. For a moment, some of your faithful followers are even sure to see you crowned with a divine light. When you regain consciousness, you have many new ideas to improve the military of your nation."
 cpbm_cathar.EVTOPT8:0 "The Consolamentum was a good idea, after all."
 cpbm_cathar.EVTNAME9:0 "A Perfect Perfect"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTDESC9:0 "While the Consolamentum is ending, you feel an intense warmth around you. Your faithful followers are even sure to see you crowned with a divine light. When you regain consciousness, you are taking a new look at the world. You have acquired the knowledge of your ancestors, and you feel ready to lead your nation towards its glorious destiny."
 cpbm_cathar.EVTOPT9:0 "So now I am... more perfect than perfect?"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTNAME10:0 "Lands Donated"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTDESC10:0 "Cathars are opposed to private property, especially for land use. For them, the land should belong to those who work it, and not to an owner who does not use it directly. A wealthly landowner in $PROVINCENAME$ has recently converted. He became a Good Man, and decided to give up all his possessions. We will be able to redistribute his lands to our people."
 cpbm_cathar.EVTOPT10:0 "These are excellent news!"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTNAME11:0 "Construction of a Perfect House"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTDESC11:0 "Cathars who are elevated to the rank of Perfects live in places called 'Houses of Perfecti', They are built in cities and villages, enabling Perfects to meet the population and preach while working in workshops. Young people are sent there by their parents for their training to their own ordination. $PROVINCENAME$ was chosen for the construction of one of these religious establishments. Its success should bring stability and prosperity to this province for decades to come."
 cpbm_cathar.EVTOPT11:0 "Great!"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTNAME12:0 "Dominic of Caleruega"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTDESC12:0 "Dominic of Caleruega, also called Dominic de Guzmán or Domingo Félix de Guzmán, is a Catholic priest born in Caleruega, in Castilla. During a visit in Rome, he received a mission from the Pope: travel to the regions affected by heresy, and preach the Gospel. He decided to found a Catholic monastery in our nation to convert Cathars. Following this affront, a theological dispute is organized over several days between Dominic and one of our Cathar bishops. However, the verbal jousting takes a surprising turn: the scriptures of the two speakers are subject to the judgment of God, and are thrown into the fire. Each orator is convinced that God alone will be able to choose which scriptures to keep..."
 cpbm_cathar.EVTOPT12:0 "I don't like the sound of that..."
 cpbm_cathar.EVTNAME13:0 "The Ordeal of Dominic of Caleruega"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTDESC13:0 "The scriptures of Dominic twirl amid the flames, but remain intact. The scriptures of the Cathars are permanently lost. Although this demonstration had little effect on the population, it is a blow to the Cathars. Dominic returned to Rome, his head held high. A few years later, he founded the Dominican order, and he will be canonized after his death. But for now, this humiliation shakes our nation, and we decide to raise the papacy to the rank of historic rival."
 cpbm_cathar.EVTOPT13:0 "Does that mean that God gave up on us?"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTNAME14:0 "The Ordeal of Dominic of Caleruega"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTDESC14:0 "The scriptures of Dominique twirl amid the flames... then burn. The scriptures of the Cathars remain intact. This is a blow to Dominic, but also for the papacy. Our orator has demonstrated that he was extremely wise, and joins our court. As for Dominic, only God knows the fate that Rome holds for him."
 cpbm_cathar.EVTOPT14:0 "God is truly on our side!"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTNAME15:0 "The Ordeal of Dominic of Caleruega"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTDESC15:0 "The scriptures of Dominique twirl amid the flames... then burn. The scriptures of the Cathars are also permanently lost. The verbal jousting ends, and everyone does his best to forget this humiliating moment when God has chosen not to keep any scripture. The clashes between Catholics and Cathars will continue, but for now, everyone goes back to duty."
 cpbm_cathar.EVTOPT15:0 "Now can we talk about something else?"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTNAME16:0 "The Troubadours"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTDESC16:0 "A troubadour is a composer, poet and musician from the Middle Ages. The first artists of this new genre appeared in the Occitanian territory, and were particularly appreciated by nobles. Soon, this artistic movement will spread to all of Europe, but History will remember $PROVINCENAME$ as the birthplace of the troubadours."
 cpbm_cathar.EVTOPT16:0 "Fantastic! Do you think they could write a song about me?"
