 cpbm_cathar.EVTNAME4:0 "Pelican Spotted!"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTDESC4:0 "In the midst of a religious ceremony, a majestic pelican appeared on the threshold of the church. The pelican is a very important symbol for Cathars. Indeed, in their scriptures, Jesus is compared to a 'pelican as bright as the Sun'. As a consequence, the sight of this bird reassures the faithful, who believe that the Lord is still watching over them."
 cpbm_cathar.EVTOPT4:0 "Fantastic!"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTNAME5:0 "Receiving the Consolamentum"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTDESC5:0 "Perfects, or Perfecti, are Cathar monks who were expected to follow a lifestyle of extreme austerity and renunciation of the world, which included abstaining from eating meat and avoiding all sexual contact. By that virtue they were recognized as spiritualized angels by their followers. As such, one of their main roles was to administer the Consolamentum to the dying. However, this sacrament could also be given to the living. The oldest Perfect of the realm came to us, offering his services to administer the Consolamentum to you. By receiving this sacrament, you will also become a Perfect, meaning that the chances to have an heir will be lowered. But in return, you might receive some valuable knowledge from the Heavens."
 cpbm_cathar.EVTOPT5A:0 "Accept the offer"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTOPT5B:0 "Politely decline the offer"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTNAME6:0 "Redeeming Knowledge for Administration"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTDESC6:0 "While the Consolamentum is ending, you feel a soft warmth around you. For a moment, some of your faithful followers are even sure to see you crowned with a divine light. When you regain consciousness, you have many new ideas to improve the administration of your nation."
 cpbm_cathar.EVTOPT6:0 "The Consolamentum was a good idea, after all."
 cpbm_cathar.EVTNAME7:0 "Redeeming Knowledge for Diplomacy"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTDESC7:0 "While the Consolamentum is ending, you feel a soft warmth around you. For a moment, some of your faithful followers are even sure to see you crowned with a divine light. When you regain consciousness, you have many new ideas to improve the diplomacy of your nation."
 cpbm_cathar.EVTOPT7:0 "The Consolamentum was a good idea, after all."
 cpbm_cathar.EVTNAME8:0 "Redeeming Knowledge for Military"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTDESC8:0 "While the Consolamentum is ending, you feel a soft warmth around you. For a moment, some of your faithful followers are even sure to see you crowned with a divine light. When you regain consciousness, you have many new ideas to improve the military of your nation."
 cpbm_cathar.EVTOPT8:0 "The Consolamentum was a good idea, after all."
 cpbm_cathar.EVTNAME9:0 "A Perfect Perfect"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTDESC9:0 "While the Consolamentum is ending, you feel an intense warmth around you. Your faithful followers are even sure to see you crowned with a divine light. When you regain consciousness, you are taking a new look at the world. You have acquired the knowledge of your ancestors, and you feel ready to lead your nation towards its glorious destiny."
 cpbm_cathar.EVTOPT9:0 "So now I am... more perfect than perfect?"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTNAME10:0 "Lands Donated"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTDESC10:0 "Cathars are opposed to private property, especially for land use. For them, the land should belong to those who work it, and not to an owner who does not use it directly. A wealthly landowner in $PROVINCENAME$ has recently converted. He became a Good Man, and decided to give up all his possessions. We will be able to redistribute his lands to our people."
 cpbm_cathar.EVTOPT10:0 "These are excellent news!"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTNAME11:0 "Construction of a Perfect House"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTDESC11:0 "Cathars who are elevated to the rank of Perfects live in places called 'Houses of Perfecti', They are built in cities and villages, enabling Perfects to meet the population and preach while working in workshops. Young people are sent there by their parents for their training to their own ordination. $PROVINCENAME$ was chosen for the construction of one of these religious establishments. Its success should bring stability and prosperity to this province for decades to come."
 cpbm_cathar.EVTOPT11:0 "Great!"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTNAME12:0 "Dominic of Caleruega"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTDESC12:0 "Dominic of Caleruega, also called Dominic de Guzmán or Domingo Félix de Guzmán, is a Catholic priest born in Caleruega, in Castilla. During a visit in Rome, he received a mission from the Pope: travel to the regions affected by heresy, and preach the Gospel. He decided to found a Catholic monastery in our nation to convert Cathars. Following this affront, a theological dispute is organized over several days between Dominic and one of our Cathar bishops. However, the verbal jousting takes a surprising turn: the scriptures of the two speakers are subject to the judgment of God, and are thrown into the fire. Each orator is convinced that God alone will be able to choose which scriptures to keep..."
 cpbm_cathar.EVTOPT12:0 "I don't like the sound of that..."
 cpbm_cathar.EVTNAME13:0 "The Ordeal of Dominic of Caleruega"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTDESC13:0 "The scriptures of Dominic twirl amid the flames, but remain intact. The scriptures of the Cathars are permanently lost. Although this demonstration had little effect on the population, it is a blow to the Cathars. Dominic returned to Rome, his head held high. A few years later, he founded the Dominican order, and he will be canonized after his death. But for now, this humiliation shakes our nation, and we decide to raise the papacy to the rank of historic rival."
 cpbm_cathar.EVTOPT13:0 "Does that mean that God gave up on us?"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTNAME14:0 "The Ordeal of Dominic of Caleruega"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTDESC14:0 "The scriptures of Dominique twirl amid the flames... then burn. The scriptures of the Cathars remain intact. This is a blow to Dominic, but also for the papacy. Our orator has demonstrated that he was extremely wise, and joins our court. As for Dominic, only God knows the fate that Rome holds for him."
 cpbm_cathar.EVTOPT14:0 "God is truly on our side!"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTNAME15:0 "The Ordeal of Dominic of Caleruega"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTDESC15:0 "The scriptures of Dominique twirl amid the flames... then burn. The scriptures of the Cathars are also permanently lost. The verbal jousting ends, and everyone does his best to forget this humiliating moment when God has chosen not to keep any scripture. The clashes between Catholics and Cathars will continue, but for now, everyone goes back to duty."
 cpbm_cathar.EVTOPT15:0 "Now can we talk about something else?"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTNAME16:0 "The Troubadours"
 cpbm_cathar.EVTDESC16:0 "A troubadour is a composer, poet and musician from the Middle Ages. The first artists of this new genre appeared in the Occitanian territory, and were particularly appreciated by nobles. Soon, this artistic movement will spread to all of Europe, but History will remember $PROVINCENAME$ as the birthplace of the troubadours."
 cpbm_cathar.EVTOPT16:0 "Fantastic! Do you think they could write a song about me?"
 cathar_leader: "Perfect Leader"
 desc_cathar_leader: "The leader received the Consolamentum before his death, making him a Perfect."

 cpbm_mormon.EVTNAME1: "Mormon Pioneers"
 cpbm_mormon.EVTDESC1: "After the foundation of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1830, its followers were persecuted by their neighbors. Under the direction of Brigham Young, Mormon pioneers started a long journey to the province of $PROVINCENAME$, where they decided to settle down, hoping to finally be able to freely practice their faith."
 cpbm_mormon.EVTOPT1: "I see."
 cpbm_mormon.EVTNAME2: "Mormonism Spreads"
 cpbm_mormon.EVTDESC2: "The influence of Mormonism has spread to $PROVINCENAME$ from a neighbouring province."
 cpbm_mormon.EVTOPT2: "Fine."
 cpbm_mormon.EVTNAME8: "The Deseret Alphabet"
 cpbm_mormon.EVTDESC8: "The Deseret alphabet is a phonological spelling reform which was created by the Board of Regents of the University of Deseret, under the leadership of Brigham Young. Young claimed that this alphabet was intended to replace the traditional Latin alphabet with an alternative, more phonetically accurate alphabet. However, until now, this writing has been taught only in schools and seminars. One of our advisors proposes to adopt this alphabet for good. The cost of such a change is important, because we will have to reprint our books and review all our official documents. However, in the long term, the use of our very own alphabet will reinforce the sense of belonging to a very unique and blessed nation."
 cpbm_mormon.EVTOPT8A: "Let's adopt this alphabet!"
 cpbm_mormon.EVTOPT8B: "Hmm... Let's not. This Mormon alphabet is all Greek to me."
 cpbm_mormon.EVTNAME9: "An Elder Stands Out"
 cpbm_mormon.EVTDESC9: "Every year, thousands of young Mormons travel the world as missionaries. Their time spent abroad is dedicated to proselytizing, Gospel teaching and servicing the community. One of these missionaries particularly distinguished. His knowledge of our religion is unparalleled. He could become one of the greatest theologians of our time, if we give him more responsibilities within our nation. In this case, the best solution would be that he integrates the governing body of our Church: the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles."
 cpbm_mormon.EVTOPT9A: "Let him join the Quorum!"
 cpbm_mormon.EVTOPT9B: "I'd rather use his skills on the field..."
 cpbm_mormon.EVTNAME10: "Mormon Gathering"
 cpbm_mormon.EVTDESC10: "Gathering has been an important part of life in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, from gathering as missionaries to gathering for worship services. A large Mormon gathering is held in the province of $PROVINCENAME$. This event took unexpected proportions: thousands of followers came, and most of them expressed their wish to stay in this province permanently."
 cpbm_mormon.EVTOPT10: "OK"
 cpbm_mormon.EVTNAME11: "Construction of a Great Temple"
 cpbm_mormon.EVTDESC11: "The number of Mormons is increasing in the province of $PROVINCENAME$. Therefore, religious infrastructure present over there became insufficient. A large fundraising has been launched by some local missionaries. They raised enough money to build one of the largest Mormon temples our nation has ever had."
 cpbm_mormon.EVTOPT11A: "Glory to God on High!"
 cpbm_mormon.EVTOPT11B: "I prefer to use their donations for the sake of our entire nation..."
 cpbm_mormon.EVTNAME12: "A Very, Very, Very Devoted Mormon Community"
 cpbm_mormon.EVTDESC12: "$PROVINCENAME$ is mostly Mormon. So far, we have tried to tolerate the presence of these misbelievers within our nation. Over time, this community has become increasingly intolerant towards our government and our laws. As a consequence, we decided to isolate them before they convert our subjects. We should better leave them alone for a while..."
 cpbm_mormon.EVTOPT12: "Now, can I get some actual good news?"
 cpbm_mormon.EVTNAME13: "Choose The Right"
 cpbm_mormon.EVTDESC13: "'Choose the right' is a motto among Mormons that is taught to children and used by members of the church as a reminder to make choices that will help an individual to live righteously. The phrase is taken from a Mormon hymn which has that title. A very talented jeweler introduced a ring with a green escutcheon bearing the letters 'CTR' in silver. This ring became a symbol of our religious affliliation. It is so successful that we now produce them in a variety of designs over thirty languages. The sales of these rings will give us prosperity for the ages to come."
 cpbm_mormon.EVTOPT13: "Glory to God on High!"
 cpbm_mormon.EVTNAME14: "Polygamy: Legacy or Infamy?"
 cpbm_mormon.EVTDESC14: "Polygamy is a social issue in our nation. In theory, Mormonism allows having several women: we also talk about plural marriage. This practice was very common at the beginning of mormonism, but is no longer practiced among a number of influential Mormon families. If this idea of plural marriage has been ordained by God, it is less and less applied inside our society. As the leader of the Mormon people, it is your duty to vote on this practice. Encouraging plural marriage would promote the growth of our nation, but would offend religious minorities. On the contrary, banning it would soothe tensions inside our nation."
 cpbm_mormon.EVTOPT14A: "Let's support polygamy! That's what God wants!"
 cpbm_mormon.EVTOPT14B: "Marriage should be between one man and one woman."

 ban_polygamy_title: "Ban Polygamy"
 ban_polygamy_desc: "A leading Mormon scholar had a revelatory experience, reporting to having struggled throughout the night with the Lord regarding the path that should be pursued. He stated that it was the Lord's will to no longer allow plural marriages."
 legalize_polygamy_title: "Legalize Polygamy"
 legalize_polygamy_desc: "Plural marriage was a common practice and one of the central doctrinal issues that defined Mormonism in its early years. The practice should not be banned if we want to call our country Mormon."
 mormon_polygamy: "Polygamy Allowed"
 desc_mormon_polygamy: "Plural marriage is encouraged. This improves our growth, but offends people of other religions."
 marital_freedom: "Polygamy Banned"
 desc_marital_freedom: "Though polygamy was a common practice in the early years of Mormonism, this it was seen by many as too extreme and disallowing it will help us better get along with those of other religions."
