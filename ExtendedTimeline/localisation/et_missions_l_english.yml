We face a choice, between on one hand adapting our society to these newcomers, likely losing part of our land to the growing state of Saro-guk (Silla) but strengthening our position through adoption of the new forms of administration, or on the other hand enforcing our heritage, while risking becoming an anachronism."

Chinese goods and knowledge flow into Jinhan and the others, and our societies are experiencing rapid change and development. With this newfound prosperity comes danger, however. The Han could cut off the flow of goods again, as Wiman did, or they could send troops further into Korea to extend their authority. We must keep the Chinese giant on good terms."

 seek_allies_jhn_desc:0 "Jinhan is not as strong as Mahan, and certainly not as strong as Han or Goguryeo. To survive, Jinhan must expand, and the best way to do so is by finding allies. The northern states of Mahan have been raided by Mohe tribes for centuries, perhaps these tribes could accomplish far more with our support. Alternatively, Baekje could be approached, and given support against Mokji so that our nations could split Mahan between us. Finally, there’s the option of a Japanese ally, made easier by the cultural similarities which remain between our peoples."

Each of the original twelve had from 600-5000 families, but those in newly conquered Byeonhan are generally smaller, and none of the statelets except Saro are as developed as we would like. To strengthen our position, we ought to encourage those from other lands to come here and settle, and so allow us to become a true urban society."

The former twelve statelets of Byeonhan: Mirimidong, Jeopdo, Gojamidong, Gosunsi, Ballo, Nangno, Gunmi, Mioyama, Gamno, Guya, Jujoma, Anya, and Dongno, are all losing relevance, replaced by the six Gayas: Geumgwan, Dae, Seongsan, Ara, Goryeong, and So, of which the first is a clear leader.

 byeonhan_army_gay_desc:0 "Up until this point, we have relied on braves, who support us for fame, to protect their tribes, or because their elders have told them to come to us. This system will simply not do with the rapid changes in society, including rapid urbanisation and increased use of iron weapons and armour. It is vital that we create a conscript force, similar to the Chinese, and institute standard training and drill. Only by doing so, and increasing the number of soldiers available to us, can we hope to survive the coming centuries."

While we in Byeonhan have been influenced significantly by arrivals from the north, many old customs are still shared between us and the Yamato, and a portion of our population even still speaks the same language.

 reformation_mhn_title:0 "Reformation"
 reformation_mhn_desc:0 "The reopening of international trade with the conquest of Wiman Joseon by the Han has brought many significant changes to our society. From a loose confederation of fifty four different statelets of up to ten thousand families each, we have become a more traditional kingdom divided between just two power centres: Baekje and Mokji. We can try to resist these changes, remaining a tribal confederation and preventing a rift from forming with the northern states around Baekje, however to do so would bring terrible consequences, and likely consign us to a footnote in history."

 phoenicia_east_mhn_desc:0 "Historians would come to call Baekje, a member of our confederation, the Phoenicia of East Asia due to its naval prowess. The Mahan coast is long, with many good places for docks and shipyards. So far, however, our naval power is underwhelming.

 naval_advisors_mhn_desc:0 "Our new fleet is the pride of our nation, but with few experienced sailors and no admirals, it will take considerable investment to convert ships into a true fighting force to project power overseas.

We should make efforts to change this by importing larger and stronger horses from the Xianbei in the north and breeding them here for our armies. By breeding only the best oxen generation after generation, we can also greatly increase the productivity of our fields, securing ever larger harvests able to feed ever greater numbers of people."

In order for us to properly centralise Mahan, Baekje must be brought to heel, for as long they maintain independence the rivalry will continue to plague Mahan, while their strength is such that, if they’re humbled, all the other statelets will submit freely."

 iron_fist_jin_desc:0 "The iron mines of Jin built our state, and while we have grown and changed a great deal since that time, iron remains vital to us, allowing us to make everything from tools to weapons and armour. With an empire like none other in history, our demand for iron has only grown, and to truly supply our state we’ll require every mine we can get our hands on."
 han_vs_han_jin_title:0 "Han Against Han"
 han_vs_han_jin_desc:0 "With the Samhan united once more we should turn our attention to the Chinese in the north of the country. With the fall of Wiman Joseon, the Han set up four Commanderies on its former territory; Lelang, Lintun, Xuantu, and Zhenfan. We should conquer all of them, justifying our expansion as a restoration of Gojoseon under the rule of the many Gojoseon refugees that fled to our lands."

 buyeo_jin_desc:0 "The last great Korean kingdom still defending its independence from us, historically Buyeo would fall in 504 under pressure from Baekje and the Xianbei. Buyeo has become a valuable ally for the Chinese as a buffer state against the Xianbei, and their continued independence prevents our nation from expanding further into the mainland. When they fall, however, we shall have formed a true kingdom of the Dongyi, united under a single banner."

 xiongnu_campaign_jin_desc:0 "Starting with the Battle of Mayi in 133 BC, the Xiongnu and Chinese have been constantly at war. Now that the Chinese are our subjects, bringing a decisive conclusion to this long war is our responsibility. The experience of the Buyeo against the Xianbei and their similar style of warfare will be invaluable in this, as will the liannu crossbow, invented during the Warring States period, and highly effective against the Xiongnu cavalry. The whole Xiongnu empire must be brought to heel so that their raiders can never threaten us again."

Called Wokou, Wako or Waegu, they strike from bases found on the many islets between our lands and the main Wa islands.

 southern_honshu_jin_desc:0 "Southern Honshu is home to two major kingdoms: Izumo, the land of bronze and silver; and Kibi, a prosperous realm of many temples and shrines. These kingdoms remain largely independent of the Yamato, but they’re powerful in their own right, and if the Yamato are able to centralise the country under their rule, it may become very difficult to dislodge them."

The Yamato kingdom is already the strongest Yayoi state, and their wealthy lands are defended by mountains. The Yamato Kingdom is largely feudal, with chiefs appointed or recognised by the Tenno.

Historically, they remained a threat until 811, and the last tribes were only brought under imperial control in the 11th century. The Emishi are renowned horse archers and raiders, and will remain a problem for our Japanese holdings until they’re made to submit."
 hokkaido_jin_title:0 "Hokkaido"
 hokkaido_jin_desc:0 "Starting in the Muromachi period, Japan would become progressively more involved with the Ainu as a result of settlements founded by refugees on the Oshima peninsula. We find ourselves in a similar position as our conquered enemies, the Emishi especially, have built up settlements on Hokkaido. The Ainu possess little besides fish and furs, but they’ve been adept at bringing us into their own conflicts as we generally support them against the Emishi newcomers. This involvement, and the frequent raids by Emishi on northern Honshu, are quickly becoming more expensive than full occupation would be, and so we should launch a campaign to take the whole island."

 king_kings_jin_desc:0 "While we are adopting many customs from the Chinese and from other Korean states, the traditional way of ruling for the Jin has always been as kings of kings, heads of great confederations united by personal or tribal loyalty. Perhaps this is not a system which should be discarded lightly, especially as our empire grows and we bring more and more peoples under our banner. Direct rule from the capital is not always practical, and loyal client states can sometimes be more useful than additional citizens."

 shikoku_jin_desc:0 "Named for its four regions, Shikoku is an agricultural island well known for its citrus fruits. It is not a particularly militarily useful place, but it would be wise to conquer it to prevent it from becoming a refuge for those who seek to fight against our rule, and the longer we delay in taking it, the more difficult it will be to prevent attacks on the rest of our Japanese holdings launched from Shikoku."
