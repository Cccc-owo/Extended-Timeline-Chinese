 dynasties.1.t:0 "The First Fitna Starts"
 dynasties.1.d:0 "For centuries, the Syrian and Mashriqi peoples have been enemies. Syrian mercenaries often times joined forces with Roman armies and fought against the Persians with their Mashriqi mercenaries. When Islam spread through the region, a very anti-borders message was spread which helped unify the conquering Caliphate. Now, however, this message is slowly being forgotten. After an assassination of the 3rd Caliph, Uthman, by Egyptian nationalists, The Umayyad dynasty, was not pleased. Mu'awiya, head of the Umayyads, was Uthman's nephew and wished for revenge. The Syrian Muslims went on to murder 4000 suspected seditionists. At first, the Rashidun Caliphate put down the vengeful mob in the Battle of the Camel, but tensions were not eased. Soon enough, Mu'awiya Umayyad revolted again and wanted to not only seek the revenge that was properly due, but also Conquer the Caliphate for himself. In history, this is known as the first Islamic Civil War."

It was her father, who after Muhammad's death, became the first Caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate. Although Aisha was in a movement against the third Caliph, Uthman, she nonetheless saw it cruel to see him assassinated.

The conflict culminated in the Battle of Karbala where Husayn and 71 of his followers were defeated and killed by 30,000 Umayyad soldiers. Becuase of this, the schism between Sunni and Shia was deepened as the Shia considered Husayn ibn Ali a martyr.

 dynasties.9.t:0 "The Abbasid Revolution"
 dynasties.9.d:0 "The Abbasids were Arabs that descended from the youngest uncle of Muhammad, Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib. It was they who viewed the Umayyads as illegitimate usurpers of the Islamic Caliphate. During the Umayyad Caliphate, the empire grew tremendously along with Islam. There were, however, many growing pains that came along with it. For starters, large parts of the Caliphate rejected Islam and stayed true to their original religion. These groups of people were often marginalized and looked down upon. Worse yet, non-arab muslims were treated the same way. Furthermore, Arab Muslims that lived outside the Arabian peninsula, such as settlers and soldiers, often felt displeased with the Caliphate for largly ignoring them. This caused massive unrest within the Umayyad Caliphate and a large number of people began to back the Abbasids as the true Caliphs of Islam. Now, Abu al-Abbas as-Saffah has begun the Abbasid Revolution, aiming to bring him and his family to power."

Soon after, he showed incredible ability in politics, persuading Shias, Sunnis, Zoroastrians, Jews, and Christians to rally under him. After being appointed governer of Syria and Egypt by the Umayyads, he continued to grow in power. Not pleased with the development, The Umayyad Caliphate attempted to assassinate Abu Muslim, to which he responded by fully supporting the Abbasids' claim on the throne."

He and his sons continued to push west, defeating the Umayyad troops twice, once in Gorgan against 10,000 men, and once in Isfahan against 50,000 men. After joining armies with with Abu Muslim and pushing towards Iraq, Qahtaba al-Tai fell in battle, tranfering the leadership of his troops to his two sons who later became influential military leaders in the early Abbasid Caliphate."

 dynasties.12.d:0 "By 750, the Abbasid armies had moved into Mesopotamia, crushing all Umayyad forces that they run in to. During the siege of Wasit, As-Saffah was crowned the new Abbasid Caliph, discrediting the Umayyads further. By April of that year, Damascus had fallen and the majority of the Umayyad family members were tracked down and killed in Egypt.

 dynasties.13.t:0 "Debate to End Arabization"
 dynasties.13.d:0 "During the Abbasid Revolution, a debate was sparked amongst the leading Arab aristocracy.

Now, the elite of our nation have begun to wonder if accepting more heathens into our ranks would be beneficial. It would destabalize our realm in the short term, but help out by lowering support for the Abbasid pretenders."

With this, the Umayyad Caliphate ended and the Abbasid Caliphate began. Across the next few centuries, the Abbasid Caliphate would make room for Islam's Golden Age, developing literature, math, and science greatly. Baghdad would become the center of the world and continue to be a marvel of its time until the sacking of it by the Mongols in the mid 13th century. Although Arabic continued to be the main language of government, many local provinces had cultural and religious freedom, decreasin unrest throughout the empire.

Finally, in 777 Abd ar-Rahmān ibn Rustam, who was one of the four original missionaries, was elected Imam. Unlike other Ibadi Imamets, this Imamete was hereditary. The justification was that Abd ar-Rahmān ibn Rustam came from no tribe, being of Persian descent, and thus would show no biase towards any of the Berber tribes in the area.
