 # Religion:
 bogomilism: "Bogomilist"
 bogomilism_religion_desc: "Bogomilism is a Christian denomination that originated in the Balkan region in the 10th century. It was a very ascetic religion that rejected the consumption of meat as well as sexual contacts. Further more it rejected the idea of worshipping crosses as well as icons and even building churches. It was a dualistic faith that saw God as the creator and ruler of the spiritual world and Satan as the ruler of the material world. In earlier, moderate versions of the religion Satan was considered inferior to God. In later, radical versions they were considered equally powerful. One idea of Bogomilism was that every person can find the true knowledge by teaching others."

 # Events:
 et_bogomilism_events.EVTNAME1: "Emergence of Bogomilism"
 et_bogomilism_events.EVTDESC1: "A recently emerged Christian movement known as Bogomilism has been gaining followers among the common folk in some of our provinces. The followers calling themselves Friends of God believe in a dualistic world with two divine beings, God, the ruler of the spiritual world, and Satan, the ruler of the material world. Many Christians see this as antithetical to their monotheistic beliefs and the established Christian churches have denounced Bogomilism as heretical."
 et_bogomilism_events1.EVTOPT1: "We need to stop them."
 et_bogomilism_events1.EVTOPT2: "It's not our business."

 et_bogomilism_events.EVTNAME2: "Spread of Bogomilism"
 et_bogomilism_events.EVTDESC2: "Bogomilism is slowly spreading in [Root.GetName] through its followers. Bogomilism rejects the ecclesiastical hierarchy, which helps them spreading among the peasantry."
 et_bogomilism_events2.EVTOPT1: "Worrisome."
 et_bogomilism_events2.EVTOPT2: "Wonderful."

 et_bogomilism_events.EVTNAME3: "Question of Livestock"
 et_bogomilism_events.EVTDESC3: "Bogomilism rejects the consumption of meat. Also other animal products like cheese and milk are not allowed as they are by-products of sexual intercourse. Nevertheless, keeping livestock is how most people make their living in some parts of our country and some religious leaders demand we put an end to their sinful practice, but doing so would surely anger some people."
 et_bogomilism_events3.EVTOPT1: "Put an end to it."
 et_bogomilism_events3.EVTOPT2: "It certainly isn't pious, but it's not that important."

 et_bogomilism_events.EVTNAME4: "A religious life for [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 et_bogomilism_events.EVTDESC4: "Recently our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has thought about living a more pious life and giving [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] life a major religious direction. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] considered the possibility to either reduce [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] work as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and focussing on religious tasks more, such as praying. Another possibility that [Root.Monarch.GetName] considered was completely giving up [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] life as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and completely turn towards a religious, pious life. In that case [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] would abdicate and become a fully integrated member of the Bogomilist Church, which will allow [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to preach and perform rituals."
 et_bogomilism_events4.EVTOPT1: "[Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] will live a more pious life. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] work as ruler will suffer from that."
 et_bogomilism_events4.EVTOPT2: "[Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] will abdicate and dedicate [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] life to God."
 et_bogomilism_events4.EVTOPT3: "[Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] will reconsider the choices and decide to focus on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] duty as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."

 et_bogomilism_events.EVTNAME5: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] displays unpious behavior"
 et_bogomilism_events.EVTDESC5: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has recently acted unpiously. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] was, allegedly, seen eating meat by one of the courtiers. There were also rumors about corruption at the court and [Root.Monarch.GetName] being more interested in monetary than spiritual wealth."
 et_bogomilism_events5.EVTOPT1: "Perhaps I have been lacking fervor, but I vow to improve my behavior."
 et_bogomilism_events5.EVTOPT2: "Nonsense! Those are rumors, nothing else but slander!"
 et_bogomilism_events5.EVTOPT3: "Nonsense! Those are rumors, nothing else but slander!"
 et_bogomilism_events5.EVTOPT4: "Nonsense! Those are rumors, nothing else but slander!"

 et_bogomilism_events.EVTNAME6: "Support for the Preachers?"
 et_bogomilism_events.EVTDESC6: "Despite our faith rejecting the usual ecclesiastical hierarchy that other denominations follow, there still must be some difference between preachers and common people. Right now, many of our preachers want to slightly touch the structure of the church in order to better increase their influence on the common people. They now want their [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to give them [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] support for their plan."
 et_bogomilism_events6.EVTOPT1: "Grant them our support."
 et_bogomilism_events6.EVTOPT2: "That's against our faith's principles. Maybe we should check what exactly they preach..."

 et_bogomilism_events.EVTNAME7: "Complaint about a Local Preacher"
 et_bogomilism_events.EVTDESC7: "The people of [target_province.GetName] have complainted to us about their local preacher. It seems they consider his behavior a bit too harsh. They describe it as so focused on an ascetic lifestyle that the population is about to starve if they would all completely comply to him."
 et_bogomilism_events7.EVTOPT1: "There is nothing wrong with the preacher, he might even be too benevolent."
 et_bogomilism_events7.EVTOPT2: "Ascetic lifestyle is our principle. But that doesn't mean we should starve to death!"

 et_bogomilism_events.EVTNAME8: "The Situation of Lay Members"
 et_bogomilism_events.EVTDESC8: "In our faith there is a rather strict separation between lay members of the church and preachers. The ceremony to become a preacher takes up to a week and the regulations for preachers are much harder than for the common people. Even though we reject other general hierarchies within the church, like other Christian religions have, this is still something lay members occasionally complain about. It might be useful to slightly improve the standing of the lay members compared to the preachers, especially since we think everybody can find and teach the true knowledge."
 et_bogomilism_events8.EVTOPT1: "Everybody can teach. Their situation should be improved."
 et_bogomilism_events8.EVTOPT2: "Everybody can teach, but maybe not everybody should."

 et_bogomilism_events.EVTNAME9: "A Sinful Nobility?"
 et_bogomilism_events.EVTDESC9: "There are movements in our country's nobility that want to push for changes to our faith's principles. The desire of the flesh, sexual contacts are strictly forbidden - even in marriage we just only tolerate it, to a degree. Certain nobles however fear for a loss of titles and loss of power for their family, if they are unable to secure their blood line - if necessary even with bastards!"
 et_bogomilism_events9.EVTOPT1: "The bloodline is pretty important, if you ask me."
 et_bogomilism_events9.EVTOPT2: "Unacceptable! They should be ashamed for their sinful wishes!"

 et_bogomilism_events.EVTNAME10: "The Church in [target_province.GetName]"
 et_bogomilism_events.EVTDESC10: "Our belief rejects the construction of churches. The human body is the temple of God, not a stone building. However, there already is a church in [target_province.GetName]. We could dismantle it, since it should be of no use for us. Or we can use it as a gathering point for announcements and teaching."
 et_bogomilism_events10.EVTOPT1: "Dismantle it. We can still use its stones..."
 et_bogomilism_events10.EVTOPT2: "Keep it. It may be useful for our reign there."

 et_bogomilism_events.EVTNAME11: "Unrest in [target_province.GetName]"
 et_bogomilism_events.EVTDESC11: "After [Root.Monarch.GetName] has appealed for an ascetic lifestyle to the people of [Root.GetName], it seems in certain parts of our realm the people are not happy about the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s actions. They demand financial aid in order to be able to fullfil the demanded changes."
 et_bogomilism_events11.EVTOPT1: "Help them."
 et_bogomilism_events11.EVTOPT2: "They are on their own."

 et_bogomilism_events.EVTNAME12: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] breaks [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] Vow of Abstinance"
 et_bogomilism_events.EVTDESC12: "There are rumors spreading at our court that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has broken [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] Vow of Abstinance. We cannot have these spread without any reaction. If it's true, it might be better to admit it..."
 et_bogomilism_events12.EVTOPT1: "I'm not proud of it, I couldn't help myself!"
 et_bogomilism_events12.EVTOPT2: "Lies! None of it is true! Who spread this rumor?"

 et_bogomilism_events.EVTNAME13: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] breaks [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] Vow of Abstinance"
 et_bogomilism_events.EVTDESC13: "With the birth of the new heir, [Root.Heir.GetName], it is evident that our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has broken [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] Vow of Abstinance. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap], who should be a good role model for the people, has failed, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] made a holy promise and broke it."
 et_bogomilism_events13.EVTOPT1: "Shameful."
 et_bogomilism_events13.EVTOPT2: "This is a misunderstanding. [Root.Heir.GetSheHeCap] is not my child, I only declared [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] my heir!"
