 et_cults.1.t:0 "Celebrating Yennayer"
 et_cults.1.d:0 "Yennayer is the first day of the agrarian year used since antiquity by Amazigh people of North Africa. It corresponds to the first day of January of the Julian Calendar. This is a widespread celebration, during which some rituals take place, mostly operations of cleansing and animal sacrifices. For this year, your advisors have suggested you take an active part in preparing the celebrations. Our people would be very grateful."
 et_cults.1.a:0 "Join in the celebrations"
 et_cults.1.b:0 "I have more important things to do!"
 et_cults.3.t:0 "Restoring the Madghacen"
 et_cults.3.d:0 "The Madghacen is a royal mausoleum-temple of the Numidian Kings, dating from the third century BC. It is a gigantic dome ringed with columns, which is the oldest preserved ancient royal mausoleum in North Africa. However, this magnificent monument is in great danger. Damaged by the ravages of time, weather and looters, the building is at risk of collapse, which would anger the ancestral spirits living in it. It is our duty to help in its restoration to keep our ancestors happy."
 et_cults.3.a:0 "We must restore this monument!"
 et_cults.3.b:0 "Nah... These are just old stones."
 et_cults.4.t:0 "Building a Pyramid"
 et_cults.4.d:0 "It is important for our $MONARCHTITLE$ to have a luxurious life after death. The traditional tombs and burial mounds are not enough to display the glory of our leaders. For this, we need bigger, more advanced tombs such as pyramids, where the $MONARCHTITLE$ can be buried along with all his most important personal items. Should we build a pyramid for our great $MONARCHTITLE$ so that the glory of his reign can be remembered eternally?"
 et_cults.4.a:0 "Let us build a big one."
 et_cults.4.b:0 "A traditional tomb will do."
 et_cults.5.t:0 "Tislit n Anzar"
 et_cults.5.d:0 "Anzar is the God of heaven, waters, rivers, seas, streams, springs and rain. He is often called Aglid n Ugfur, which means \"King of the rain\". A rite known as Tislit n Anzar (The Bride of Anzar) is dedicated to him during periods of drought to rain. The province of $PROVINCENAME$ is about to organize one of these ceremonies, and would like you to be there so they will get the favors of Anzar."
 et_cults.5.a:0 "I want to participate in this ceremony."
 et_cults.5.b:0 "I wish I could, but I don't want to."
 et_cults.6.t:0 "A Night With the Dead"
 et_cults.6.d:0 "In the cult of the dead, the ancestors are deified and revered. When someone wants to invoke them to ask something, he sleeps in their mausoleums so that they will receive answers in their dreams. While you go through a bad patch, you think about the idea of spending a night among your ancestors. Do you feel ready to share your doubts with the rulers of distant past?"
 et_cults.6.a:0 "I am sure my ancestors will answer my call."
 et_cults.6.b:0 "Uh... This idea sounds a little too creepy."
 et_cults.7.t:0 "A Night With the Dead"
 et_cults.7.d:0 "You went into the tomb of your ancestors. It took you a long time to fall sleep, because the idea of being among deceased people did not particularly please you. After a long night, you woke up with no answers to your questions. However, you caught a beautiful cold from the cold and humid air of the tomb. You will be in bed for several days, but your people are happy that you have honored their traditions."
 et_cults.7.a:0 "Achoo!"
 et_cults.8.t:0 "A Night With the Dead"
 et_cults.8.d:0 "You went into the tomb of your ancestors. It took you a long time to fall sleep, because the idea of being among deceased people did not particularly please you. After a long night, you woke up with the feeling of having acquired the knowledge of your ancestors. You come out of the grave smiling, ready to lead your nation to glory."
 et_cults.8.a:0 "Fantastic!"
 et_cults.9.t:0 "A Night With the Dead"
 et_cults.9.d:0 "Last night, our $MONARCHTITLE$ entered the tomb of his ancestors. However, in the morning, one of the guards guarding the tomb found the $MONARCHTITLE$ dead on the tomb floor. No one knows what happened. Maybe an assassin was able to sneak into the tomb, or maybe this is a sign from the ancestors that someone else would be better suited to rule us."
 et_cults.9.a:0 "Fant... Wait, what do you mean by 'Our leader is dead'?"
 et_cults.10.t:0 "Affinities With Hellenism"
 et_cults.10.d:0 "Our people are worshipping Saturn and some other gods of Roman origin. This has been noticed by some of our neighbours who worship the same gods, which has made them consider our cultures to be closer to each other and think of us as more civilized than other African tribes. This has improved our diplomatic relations with them."
 et_cults.10.a:0 "Great"
 et_cults.11.t:0 "Affinities With Egyptian Religion"
 et_cults.11.d:0 "Our people are worshipping Ammon and some other gods of Egyptian origin.

This has improved our diplomatic relations with them."

 et_cults.12.t:0 "Hellenic Influences"
