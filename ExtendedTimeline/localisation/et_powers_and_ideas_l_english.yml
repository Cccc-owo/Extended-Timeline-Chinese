 against_the_three_powers_desc: "The original three powers we fought against, the Pandyas, the Cholas, and the Cheras, are who we fought against in the beginning. Their unjust authority brought about countless times of suffering and hardship that the Tamil people did not deserve! We will be the ones to beat them backa nd to the Tamil people right by promoting a more stable and just system of governance."
 buddhism_jainism_hinudism: "The Three Faiths"
 buddhism_jainism_hinudism_desc: "Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism all have a home in the lands of Tamilakam and we must be accepting of this fact. Each ruler of ours has a myriad of influences upon them from each religion in our nation and as such will need to balance out which religion is paid the most and the least attention. Openly persecuting one or many religions in our land will only lead to societal division that we do not need."

 patronize_tamil_literature_desc: "The others before us failed to promote the literature of the Tamil people, but our rulers see the need and the useful nature of literature as a whole.

 border_skirmishing_in_tamilakam: "Rough Borders"
 border_skirmishing_in_tamilakam_desc: "The landscape of Tamilakam and even in surrounding regions does not permit for well defined borders. Often times our troops will skirmish with enemy contingents due to these ambiguous borders, leading to the need for more firm and secure fortifications near our border. If the Kalabhras are to survive into the future, the borders will need to be secured and our enemies will need to be kept at bay."
 secure_our_subjects: "Secure the Kalabhra State"
 secure_our_subjects_desc: "There are many small subject states around the Kalabhras that need to be successfully integrated into our state over time, lest we wish them to become sources of rebellion in the future. The influences of the previous three powers are still strong enough in some areas that they can spark tension in local communities that slowly evolves into a stronger and more serious revolt in our own territory. Integration and assimilation efforts must and will continue to be a strong focus for us well into the future."

 unification_of_the_tamils_desc: "Before us, there was disunity, but after us, there has been solace and peace... For the most part. The Tamil people may be attached to their previous dynastic lineages and local leaders, but the Kalabhras need to promote a higher idea or ideal to the Tamil people over time. Uniting them into one cohesive state has been a goal of several leaders in the past and once they are, the Tamil people will be a truly grand force to be reckoned with on the entire subcontinent."
 kalabhra_administration: "Kalahbhra Administrative Efforts"
 kalabhra_administration_desc: "The administration of the Kalabhras is a source of contention for some but also a source of prosperity and opportunity for many others. Reform efforts and changes over time to suit the Tamil people have been made and continuing to slowly implement more changes that are directed at ensuring prosperity and stability for the Tamil people will only serve to strengthen the Kalabhra state. In time, we will see our cities grow like never before and our people grow to heights previously thought to be impossible."

In time, this prosperity will be felt in the form of monumental amounts of trade revenue."

 promote_chera_coinage_desc: "Copper and silver coins are not uncommon in our domain as influences from northern kingdoms and empires have helped shape our economy and what we use to signify the power of a ruler. By controlling how much we mint and also trying to control the quality of our coin production, we can combat economic declines that some other states feel when they lose control of their own coins in circulation."

 rein_in_the_chera_branches_desc: "Though our name is well known beyond our borders, inside our domain, the name 'Chera' is seldom used by local authorities since they prefer to have their own local dynasties and regimes whilst paying nominal service to the Cheras above them. It is time we strengthen the authority of the Chera administration and slowly centralize the structure of things so that our leader is the actual undisputed ruler of the land."

 beyond_the_traditional_tamil_lands_desc: "Conquests done by us have taken us not only to the edges of the homeland of the Tamils, but it has also taken us to places beyond what we normally call home. The heart of the Deccan, the Bengal River Delta, perhaps even the ports in the Gujuarat region are within our grasp if we can consolidate our power and formalize our fighting forces.

The ocean around the southern part of the subcontinent is just such a vast region where trade routes flow through all the time and it shall be a viable target for Chola ships and influence in the future. In future centuries and generations, it will perhaps be known as the 'Chola Ocean'."

Each tribe that makes up our federation has had their own leader in some form and those leaders are who assemble regularly to help decide taxes, land reform, and what laws should be passed or reformed. By expanding and refining this council system to represent more smaller minorities in the federation, we will become all the more stable."

They fought and died for there to be no Christianity in our lands, for there to be no influence from the Holy Roman Empire on our people, and for there to be no feudalism stemming from Christian dukes and bishops.

 homeland_advantage_of_the_lutici_desc: "What is unfortunate for our enemies in the Holy Roman Empire and in Poland is that the lands of the Lutici Federation are not crowded with grand cities with fortified walls all around. We have smaller cities and villages that provide men and taxes as well as a suitable defensive position when needed, but they are also situated in a much harsher terrain with denser forests and marshes crowding the path to get to them."

They attempted to intervene in our political struggles and ultimately help break the old federation down enough for the Christians to invade successfully. Let us learn from this time and firmly situate our politics inside the Lutici Federation once and for all; internal leadership is the way to stability and success, rather than relying on foreign armies for aid in securing power."

 the_destruction_of_bishoprics_desc: "If there is one thing that symbolizes the Christian encroachment into Lutici lands, it is the setting up of bishoprics to help convert the population of locals. The Great Slave Rising destroyed the likes of the Bishoprics of Brandenburg and Havelburg, signifying our defiance of Christian authority and conversion efforts. Thus, when we invade more Christian land, we will destroy even more bishoprics and de-convert the lands the Christians think they own with impunity."

 the_organization_of_hoysala_admin_desc: "A well organized government is what our empire relies upon to keep up with its people and also foreign powers in the world. There are high-ranking positions that report directly to our leader, senior ministers responsible for foreign affairs, a chief treasurer, a specific chief of justice, and so many other positions that we keep track of in an ordered system.

As a result to its strategic location and proximity to the uncontrolled lands to the North and East, it was heavily developed and fortified. Home to an imperial palace amongst the residents of the city was the Emperor Diocletian. The rise of Christianity in the Empire brought Aquileia to new heights, chosen to be the site of various Councils of Aquileia. The fall of the Empire reduced Aquileia’s strategic importance, and power, however, and the various barbaric invasions wrecked havoc on the city. Pillaged over the centuries, and rocked by Magyar raids, Aquileia lies as a mare shadow of its former self, waiting to be rebuilt and restored."
