 desc_new_world_i:0 "The discovery of the New World has heralded a new era not only for the colonizers and the colonized, it has lead to a spread of materials and techniques as well as a realization of the vast size of the globe. As animals, crop types, silver and diseases spread across the Atlantic the first steps have been taken towards a truly global economy and as foreign lands and people are mapped and documented ideas as well as religious and philosophical debate has become more and more colored by what we have found in overseas societies. Great minds feel the need to question what was once truth and from Valladolid to Fatehpur Sikri the nature of the world is now up for debate."
 desc_writing:0 "As human societies emerged, the development of writing was driven by pragmatic exigencies such as exchanging information, maintaining financial accounts, codifying laws and recording history. Around the 4th millennium BC, the complexity of trade and administration in Mesopotamia outgrew human memory, and writing became a more dependable method of recording and presenting transactions in a permanent form. Even millenia after its invention writing remains one of the most important requirements for the emergence civilized societies and great technological and intellectual achievements would be impossile without it."
 desc_legalism:0 "Legalism is a classical school of Chinese philosophy that groups thinkers crucial to laying the 'intellectual and ideological foundations of the traditional bureaucratic empire'. Often compared with modern social sciences, they have been regarded as having three tendencies: the enforcement of law, the manipulation of statecraft, and the exercise of power, articulating political technique that would ultimately form guiding principles for the Emperors of China. Highly effective in the short run, their dismissiveness of traditional culture, morality and anti-ministerial approach earned them enmity, causing them to be often overlaid with traditional ideology and customs."
 desc_ancient_imperialism:0 "Imperialism is a policy that means extending a country's power through military and diplomacy. Its name originates from the Latin word imperium, which means to rule over large territories. Generally this means a multi-ethnic or multinational state with political and military dominion of populations who are culturally and ethnically distinct from the ruling imperial ethnic group and its culture. The Romans were the first nation to invent and embody the concept of empire in their two mandates: to wage war and to make and execute laws. They were the most extensive Western empire until the early modern period, and left a lasting impact on Western Europe."
 desc_caste_system:0 "Caste is a form of social stratification characterized by endogamy, hereditary transmission of a lifestyle which often includes an occupation, ritual status in a hierarchy, and customary social interaction and exclusion based on cultural notions of purity and pollution. Its paradigmatic ethnographic example is the division of society into rigid social groups, with roots in ancient history and persisting until today. Sometimes, sociologists and anthropologists study the caste-like social divisions existing in various countries by using the Indian caste system as an analogical basis for research."
 desc_organized_religion:0 "Organized religion, also known as institutional religion, is religion as a social institution, in which belief systems and rituals are systematically arranged and formally established. Organized religion is typically characterized by an official doctrine or dogma, a hierarchical or bureaucratic leadership structure, and a codification of rules and practices. Due to their structured, standardized, and so easily proliferated form, organized religions comprise many of the world's major religious groups."
 desc_serfdom:0 "Serfdom is a condition of bondage, which developed primarily during the High Middle Ages in Europe and lasted in some countries until the mid-19th century. Serfs who occupied a plot of land were required to work for the lord of the manor who owned that land, and in return were entitled to protection, justice and the right to exploit certain fields within the manor to maintain their own subsistence. Serfs were often required not only to work on the lord's fields, but also his mines, forests and roads. The manor formed the basic unit of feudal society, and the lord of the manor and his serfs were bound legally, economically, and socially. Serfs formed the lowest social class of feudal society."
 desc_manorialism:0 "Manorialism was the organizing principle of rural economy that originated in the villa system of the Late Roman Empire. It was widely practiced in medieval western and parts of central Europe, and was slowly replaced by the advent of a money-based market economy and new forms of agrarian contract. Manorialism was characterised by the vesting of legal and economic power in a Lord of the Manor, supported economically from his own direct landholding in a manor, and from the obligatory contributions of a legally subject part of the peasant population under the jurisdiction of himself and his manorial court. These obligations could be payable in several ways, in labor, in kind, or, on rare occasions, in coin."
 desc_early_feudalism:0 "The classic version of feudalism describes a set of reciprocal legal and military obligations among the warrior nobility, revolving around the three key concepts of lords, vassals and fiefs. A lord was in broad terms a noble who held land, a vassal was a person who was granted possession of the land by the lord, and the land was known as a fief. In exchange for the use of the fief and the protection of the lord, the vassal would provide some sort of service to the lord. There were many varieties of feudal land tenure, consisting of military and non-military service. The obligations and corresponding rights between lord and vassal concerning the fief form the basis of the feudal relationship."
 desc_crop_rotation:0 "Agriculturalists have long recognized that suitable rotations - such as planting spring crops for livestock in place of grains for human consumption - make it possible to restore or to maintain a productive soil. Middle Eastern farmers already practised crop rotation in 6000 BC without understanding the chemistry, alternately planting legumes and cereals. From the times of Charlemagne, farmers in Europe transitioned from a two-field crop rotation to a three-field crop rotation. From the end of the Middle Ages until the 20th century, Europe's farmers practised three-field rotation, dividing available lands into three parts. One section was planted in the autumn with rye or winter wheat, followed by spring oats or barley; the second section grew crops such as peas, lentils, or beans; and the third field was left fallow."
 desc_civil_service:0 "The origin of the modern meritocratic civil service can be traced back to Imperial examination founded in Imperial China. The Imperial exam based on merit was designed to select the best administrative officials for the state's bureaucracy. This system had a huge influence on both society and culture in Imperial China and was directly responsible for the creation of a class of scholar-bureaucrats irrespective of their family pedigree. In theory, the civil service system provided one of the major outlets for social mobility in medieval societies, although in practice, due to the time-consuming nature of the study, the examination was generally only taken by sons of the elite."
 desc_manuscripts:0 "Manuscript culture uses manuscripts to store and disseminate information; in the West, it generally preceded the age of printing. In early manuscript culture, monks copied manuscripts by hand. They copied not just religious works, but a variety of texts including some on astronomy, herbals, and bestiaries. Medieval manuscript culture deals with the transition of the manuscript from the monasteries to the market in the cities, and the rise of universities. Manuscript culture in the cities created jobs built around the making and trade of manuscripts, and typically was regulated by universities."
 desc_scholasticism:0 "Scholasticism is a method of critical thought which dominated teaching by the academics of medieval universities in Europe from about 1100 to 1700, and a program of employing that method in articulating and defending dogma in an increasingly pluralistic context. It originated as an outgrowth of and a departure from Christian monastic schools at the earliest European universities. The first institutions in the West to be considered universities were established in Italy, France, Spain, and England in the late 11th and the 12th centuries for the study of arts, law, medicine, and theology, such as Schola Medica Salernitana, the University of Bologna, and the University of Paris."
 desc_guilds:0 "Guilds are associations of artisans or merchants who control the practice of their craft in a particular town. The earliest types of guild were formed as confraternities of tradesmen. They were organized in a manner something between a professional association, trade union, a cartel, and a secret society. They often depended on grants of letters patent by a monarch or other authority to enforce the flow of trade to their self-employed members, and to retain ownership of tools and the supply of materials. A lasting legacy of traditional guilds are the guildhalls constructed and used as meeting places. An important result of the guild framework was the emergence of universities in medieval Europe."
 desc_medicine:0 "Medicine is the science and practice of the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease. Though medicine has existed since the ancient times, a major shift in medical thinking occurred during the Black Death in the 14th and 15th centuries, as the 'traditional authority' approach to science and medicine was gradually abandoned. Many medieval physicians such as Andreas Vesalius improved upon and disproved some of the past theories from the past."
 desc_imperialism:0 "Imperialism is a policy of extending a country's power and influence through colonization, use of military force, or other means. Imperialism is particularly focused on the control that one group, often a state power, has on another group of people. This is often through various forms of 'othering' based on racial, religious, or cultural stereotypes. The Age of Imperialism, a time period beginning around 1700, saw European industrializing nations, engaging in the process of colonizing, influencing, and annexing other parts of the world in order to gain political power. Imperialism has been subject to moral or immoral censure by its critics, but it has also allowed for the rapid spread of technologies and ideas into colonial territories."
 desc_industrialization:0 "The Industrial Revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840. This transition included going from hand production methods to machines, new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes, improved efficiency of water power, the increasing use of steam power, the development of machine tools and the rise of the factory system. Textiles were the dominant industry of the Industrial Revolution in terms of employment, value of output and capital invested; the textile industry was also the first to use modern production methods. The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain and most of the important technological innovations were British."
 desc_nationalism_institution:0 "Nationalism is a shared group feeling in the significance of a geographical and sometimes demographic region seeking independence for its culture or ethnicity that holds that group together. This can be expressed as a belief or political ideology that involves an individual identifying with or becoming attached to one's nation. The early emergence of a popular patriotic nationalism took place in the mid-18th century, and was actively promoted by the European governments and by the writers and intellectuals of the time. National symbols, anthems, myths, flags and narratives were assiduously constructed and adopted. The political development of nationalism and the push for popular sovereignty culminated with the national revolutions of Europe, such as the Greek War of Independence of 1821–1829. Since that time, nationalism has become one of the most significant political and social forces in history."
 desc_electrification:0 "Electrification is the build out of the electrical generating and distribution systems which occurred in Britain, the United States, and other countries from the mid-1880s until around 1950. Although early electricity was very expensive compared to today, it was far cheaper and more convenient than oil, steam power or manual labor making the period of electrification of factories and households one of high productivity and economic growth. Some experts consider electrification the greatest engineering achievement of the 20th Century."
 desc_globalization:0 "Globalization is the process of international integration arising from the interchange of world views, products, ideas, and other aspects of culture. Advances in transportation and in telecommunications infrastructure have been major factors in globalization, generating further interdependence of economic and cultural activities. Large-scale globalization began in the 19th century and throughout 20th century the connectivity of the world's economies and cultures grew very quickly."
 desc_internet:0 "The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that links billions of devices worldwide. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web, electronic mail, newsgroups, voice over IP telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing. The origins of the Internet date back to research commissioned by the United States federal government in the 1960s to build robust, fault-tolerant communication via computer networks. Internet use grew rapidly in the West from the mid-1990s and from the late 1990s in the developing world. In the 20 years since 1995, Internet use has grown 100-times."

 et_institutions.18.d:0 "Crop rotation is the practice of growing a series of different types of crops in the same area in sequential seasons. Under the three-field system, the arable land of an estate or village is divided into three large fields: one is planted in the autumn with winter wheat or rye; the second field is planted with other crops such as peas, lentils, or beans; and the third is left fallow, in order to allow the soil of that field to regain its nutrients. With each rotation, the field is used differently, so that a field would be planted for two out of the three years used, whilst one year it 'rests'. Previously a two-field system had been in place, with half the land being left fallow. The three field system allows farmers to plant more crops and therefore to increase production and legumes have the ability to fix nitrogen and so fertilize the soil. With more crops available to sell, this also helps the economy in general to thrive."
