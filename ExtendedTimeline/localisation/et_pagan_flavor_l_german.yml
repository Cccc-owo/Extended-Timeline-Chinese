In fact, sacrifices to household dieties were common and included giving up things such as fruits, wheat, honey, wine incense, or even food that fell off the dinner table. The most potent sacrifices involved animals. They were first cleansed and then calmed due to the fact that tradition stated that the harmonisation of the earthly and divine was necessary. In other words, the animal needed to willingly offer its life and remain calm throughout its death. There were also recorded instances of human sacrifice during the early period of the Roman Republic, but this practice was officially ruled as murder in 81BC."

Now, having a large kingdom, the time has come to choose between enforcing a national pantheon, or allowing local pantheons to remain widespread. If a unifying pantheon is introduced, it would help unite the nation and decrease local power. If, however, we allow for local pantheons, our subjects will be less likely to revolt."

She killed her husband and with the God of spring dead, the world's vegitation dies and the cold seeps in uniformaly. Morana then dies at the end of the year. This cycle repeats itself year after year and was used to explain the change in seasons. Now, we should choose which God we would support more.

Through their work they influenced the cultural development of all Slavs, for which they received the title Apostles to the Slavs. They are credited with devising the Glagolitic alphabet, the first alphabet used to transcribe Old Church Slavonic.

The city was considered a holy site in which both Egyptian and Nubian dieties were worshiped and was believed to be the place where the ancient Egyptian diety Amun was born. Likewise, Jebel Barkal served as the burial gounds for many of the Nubian Kings. Now, the once proud city of Napata has begun to crumble.

Atenism was distinct from other religions nearby in that it was Henotheistic. In other words, Aten was treated as the supreme God, yet the other egyptian dieties were considered sub gods. Amenhotep IV changed his name to Akhenaten and his capital to the newly created Akhetaten. Atenism believed that the sun-disk God Aten was the giver of all life, and through him all things are connected. Unfortunately, this heresy did not last long as after Akhenaten's death, the religion faded away and the court moved to another city. Due to the recent conquest of Akhetaten, interest has piqued about this old heresy. Now the decision rests in the hands of our King, whether to reinstate Atenism, or ignore it."

Egyptian oracles are known mainly from the New Kingdom and afterward, though they probably appeared much earlier. People of all classes, including the king, asked questions of oracles, and, especially in the late New Kingdom their answers could be used to settle legal disputes or inform royal decisions. The most common means of consulting an oracle was to pose a question to the divine image while it was being carried in a festival procession, and interpret an answer from the barque's movements. Other methods included interpreting the behavior of cult animals, drawing lots, or consulting statues through which a priest apparently spoke. The means of discerning the god's will gave great influence to the priests who spoke and interpreted the god's message."
