 yellow_turban_rebellion: "Yellow Turban Rebellion"
 desc_yellow_turban_rebellion: "A Taoist sect known as the Way of the Supreme Peace has recently significantly grown in numbers. Its leaders are reknowned healers among all classes of Han society, and their growing influence across the social classes, most significantly the peasant class, is seen as a threat by many in the Han court. Wearing yellow turbans as a symbol of their faith and unity, their members continue to grow in number, and we fear they may one day rise in rebellion against the Han dynasty."
 
 abbasid_fitna: "Abbasid Fitna"
 desc_abbasid_fitna: "Although the Abbasids reign as the official leaders of the Islamic world, the great size, power and influence of our realm is the source of jealously for many in our realm, several of which are scions of the Abbasid dynasty itself. Besides the various relatives of the Caliph, we also faced sectarian resistance from the Kharijites and Alids who live in our borders. Furthermore, the growing influence of the Turkic generals in the Caliphate is also a great source of concern for any ambitious Caliph who wishes to maintain their undisputed authority, with no strings attached, in the Caliphate. Thus, just as the Rashidun and Umayyad Caliphates have faced, perhaps it may be inevitable that we may one day face a Fitna of our own."
 
 byzantine_anarchy: "Byzantine Anarchy"
 desc_byzantine_anarchy: "It has been long since the glory days of the Roman Empire. The subjects of the Roman Emperor in Constantinople are becoming disillusioned by failed attempts to restore the empire to its former glory, and the loyalty of the soldiers to the Roman Emperor and his aspirations is not guaranteed. Thus, should a notable pretender ever gain enough of a following to openly revolt against the Emperor, such a pretender would surely be only a symptom of the real disorder and unrest that is yet to come."

 yellow_turban_rebellion.1.t: "Yellow Turban Rebellion"
 yellow_turban_rebellion.1.desc: "It is as we have dreaded. Though [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and the eunuchs of the Imperial capital have tried to ignore the recent movements of the Way of the Supreme Peace, it seems that we can no longer ignore the cries of the struggling peasantry. Having coordinated with other followers of the Daoist sect across the land, the leaders of the Way of the Supreme Peace and their followers have donned yellow scarves atop their heads and raised up arms against the Han dynasty. With countless rebels across the land now wearing yellow scarves, their slogan can be heard echoing across the skies:\n\n'The Azure Sky is already dead; the Yellow Sky will soon rise!\nWhen the year is jiazi, there will be prosperity under Heaven!'"
 yellow_turban_rebellion.1.a: "How dare they defy the Son of Heaven!"
 yellow_turban_rebellion.2.t: "Yellow Turban Crisis Averted"
 yellow_turban_rebellion.2.desc: "Although our realm has been utterly devastated by the Yellow Turban Rebellion and the subsequent crisis, we have finally crushed the rebels and returned peace to the land. Though we may still have a long way to go before we can establish stability and prosperity to our dynasty and people, at the very least we have ensured the survival of the Han dynasty for the foreseeable future."
 yellow_turban_rebellion.2.a: "May the Han reign for ten thousand of ten thousand years!"

 yellow_turban_rebellion.3.desc: "Seeing the chaos faced by the Han in the heartland of the empire, a group of Qiang tribesmen have rebelled against our rule in our westernmost frontier province of Liang. Its Inspector as well as its administrators have all surrendered to the Qiang rebels, and some of them have even joined the Qiang forces as commanders of their rebel armies. With troubles across the empire, we may not be able to directly deal with these rebels in the foreseeable future..."
 yellow_turban_rebellion.3.a: "Traitors, all of them!"
 yellow_turban_rebellion.3.tt: "Already happened: Liang Province and its administrators break away from the Han"
 yellow_turban_rebellion.4.t: "Inspectors Given Autonomy"
 yellow_turban_rebellion.4.desc: "A court official and scion of the Han dynasty named Liu Yan has convinced the Emperor that the Yellow Turbans were allowed to organize due to the weak authority of the various Inspectors who govern the provinces of the Han. Thus, in accordance with Liu Yan's suggestions, the imperial court has decided to promote the Inspectors to the rank of Governor, granting them greater autonomy in the farther reaches of the empire for the sake of putting an end to the chaos and unrest caused by the rebellion. With the central power of the Han concentrated in Central Plains, the southern Governors have therefore acquired significant autonomy as administrators of the Han barbarian frontier."
 yellow_turban_rebellion.4.tt: "Yang, Jing, Yi and Jiaozhi provinces are granted autonomy, being released as Marches of the Han"

 yellow_turban_rebellion.8.t: "Advisor Suspected of Treason"
 yellow_turban_rebellion.8.desc: "One of our Emperor's closest advisors has been suspected of supplying information to and cooperating with the leaders of the Yellow Turbans. Although executing the traitor should be no question, the advisor has built up a network of allies within the imperial court who would be more than eager to sweep away all of the accusations in exchange for the advisor continuing to serve us in their full capacity."

 yellow_turban_rebellion.9.desc: "The local peasants of [han_yt_disaster_rebel_province.GetAreaName] have risen up in revolt, inspired by the Yellow Turban Rebellion and tired of the abuses and neglect they experienced from local Han administrators and officials. Since we currently have more dire issues at hand to be concerned with, we could perhaps consider dealing with this without resorting to battle."
 yellow_turban_rebellion.9.a: "Crush the peasant rebels"
 yellow_turban_rebellion.9.b: "Give in to their demands"
 yellow_turban_rebellion.10.t: "Opportunistic Nomadic Raid"
 yellow_turban_rebellion.10.desc: "Seeing the crisis faced by our state, a large group of nomadic barbarians have crossed into our lands and are now leading raids against our vulnerable peoples along the frontier. If we accept their demands and pay them a sum of gold, they may leave our lands and people alone as we deal with matter more directly threatening to our dynasty's very survival."

 yellow_turban_rebellion.11.desc: "Seeing the devastation brought upon the people of the Han by the vile Yellow Turban rebels, some civilians, including a sandal weaver who claims descendance from the Han dynasty, have formed militias that now offer their services to the Han dynasty against all who wish harm upon the Emperor and his subjects."

 yellow_turban_rebellion.12.t: "Local Prefect Recruits Han Loyalists"
 yellow_turban_rebellion.12.desc: "A prefect has recruited Han loyalists from his prefecture. While there are many among the lower classes who treacherously wish for our downfall, it seems that there are still just and respectable subjects of the Han in these lands who wish to serve their Emperor."
 yellow_turban_rebellion.12.a: "We welcome all who wish to fight for us"
 yellow_turban_rebellion.13.t: "Liaodong Autonomy"
 yellow_turban_rebellion.13.desc: "When an empire crumbles from within, oftentimes the frontier lands are among the first to break away from the heartland. Thus, when the Yellow Turban Rebellion broke out, the Administrator of Liaodong, Gongsun Du, used the opportunity to ensure greater autonomy for his realm and appointing himself Governor of Pingzhou. With a great rebellion to deal with, we have little choice but to allow their de facto autonomy from the Han empire for the time being."
 yellow_turban_rebellion.13.a: "We shall return to Liaodong one day..."

 yellow_turban_rebellion.14.desc: "Although the Yellow Turban rebellion began in the northeast in the  Ji, Jing, You and Yu provinces of the northeast, many peasants inspired by the Yellow Turban movement across the empire have taken up arms. One Yellow Turban leader in Yi Province named Ma Xiang has acquired an especially large following and, with their backing, has killed the province's Inspector and has been declared Emperor by his followers."

 yellow_turban_rebellion.15.desc: "A self-proclaimed general by the name of Ou Xing has gathered a sizeable army of bandits and has been spotted marching towards the lands of Changsha.

 yellow_turban_rebellion.16.t: "Eunuchs Ignore Rebel Reports"
 yellow_turban_rebellion.16.desc: "As close and trusted attendants of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], all reports must pass through the hands of the eunuchs before it can reach the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Perhaps hoping to ignore the widespread crisis and remain sheltered in the comfort of the imperial palace, the eunuchs have chosen to prevent all dire reports from reaching the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."

 yellow_turban_rebellion.17.t: "The Yellow Sky Reigns!"
 yellow_turban_rebellion.17.desc: "'The Azure Sky is already dead; the Yellow Sky will soon rise!\nWhen the year is jiazi, there will be prosperity under Heaven!'\n\nThis was the slogan chanted by the Yellow Turban rebels, and the rebels may have been proven correct - it seems that the Mandate of Heaven may have truly fallen out of our hands. Seizing the ancestral Han capital of Luoyang and marching into the capital as the Han Emperor flees, the Yellow Turbans have declared their leader Zhang Jue as Emperor and the new Son of Heaven.\n\nZhang Jue has now declared himself the founder of the new Zhao dynasty, since he and the Zhang brothers were born in Julu Commandery, the ancestral homeland of the Zhao State of the Warring States period. With the Han facing dire times, many in our court, provinces and armies are faced with the dilemma of choosing a side."

 #Abbasid Fitna
 abbasid_fitna.1.t: "Anarchy at $CAPITAL_CITY$"
 abbasid_fitna.1.desc: "The shocking news spreads quickly through the capital in $CAPITAL_CITY$ - the Caliph is dead! The Caliph was found dead in the palace, and it is suspected that the assassination was carried out by the Caliph's own Turkic soldiers. It is said that the Caliph and his vizier were eating in the Caliph's personal chambers when the Turkic soldiers attacked. However, as the Turkic generals themselves possess great military influence in the capital, and thus this story has been dismissed as mere rumors - the official story now is that the Caliph had tragically choked to death on his drink."
 abbasid_fitna.1.a: "We mourn the death of our late yet great Caliph"
 abbasid_fitna.1.tt: "Already happened: The Caliph chokes on his drink and passes away"
 abbasid_fitna.2.t: "Abbasid Fitna Averted"
 abbasid_fitna.2.desc: "The various notable Fitna of history have resulted in the downfall and collapse of both the Rashidun and Umayyad Caliphates that came before us. Although we and our people have suffered greatly, we have successfully endured the Fitna of our times and have brought the Abbasid Caliphate from the brink of destruction. Although there is much work to do in restoring prosperity and order to our realm, the Abbasid dynasty lives on, proving to all that we have passed our great test of faith and are the true and undisputed leaders of Islam."
 abbasid_fitna.2.a: "Glory to the Caliph!"
 abbasid_fitna.3.t: "Mysterious Death of the Caliph"
 abbasid_fitna.3.desc: "As if there were not enough troubles to deal with already, we were shocked to find that the Caliph has mysteriously passed away! With the constant plotting in the court along with the cause of death being so unclear, it is unsurprising that there are many rumors circulating, though many can agree that they are convinced the Caliph was poisoned.\n\nThe influential Turkic generals, now seen as kingmakers by some, have gone ahead with the selection of a new successor. Among the family members, the Turkic generals were able to acquire the choice of heir from the Caliph himself before he passed away. In his deathbed, the Caliph chose..."
 abbasid_fitna.3.a: "...his brother Al-Mu'tazz"
 abbasid_fitna.3.b: "...his brother Al-Mu'ayyad"
 abbasid_fitna.3.c: "...his cousin Al-Musta'in"
 abbasid_fitna.4.t: "Rivals Challenge the Caliph!"
 abbasid_fitna.4.desc: "Although the Turkic generals confirmed our Caliph as the rightful successor following the sudden death of his close relative, the previous Caliph, the other two contenders for the Caliphate are not overjoyed at having been passed over, to say the least. Thus, it seems that the two rivals have both claimed the title of Caliph for themselves, and now they lead an army of loyalists against us as pretenders to the throne."
 abbasid_fitna.4.a: "We shall not give in to the likes of them!"
 abbasid_fitna.5.t: "Rivals Executed!"
 abbasid_fitna.5.desc: "The Abbasid scions who dared raise arms against our Caliph as pretenders to the throne have been utterly defeated in battle. Although they were promised mercy, our Caliph has decided to execute them for their insolence.\n\nThe executioner brought their heads before the Caliph and declared the death of the pretender; however, the Caliph, playing chess, told the executioner 'Lay the heads aside until I have finished my game.'"

 abbasid_fitna.6.a: "We must quash them at once!"
 abbasid_fitna.7.t: "Zanj Rebellion"
 abbasid_fitna.7.desc: "A massive rebellion has broken out among the slaves from the Zanj region of Southeast Africa who had been sold to our markets for use as slave labor in plantations. The working and living conditions of the Zanj slaves were miserable - in hindsight, a rebellion like this should have been anticipated. Joined by several freemen as well as slaves of other cultures who are dissatisfied with Abbasid rule, the Zanj rebels have inspired slave rebellions across the realm."
 abbasid_fitna.7.a: "This is getting out of hand!"
 abbasid_fitna.8.t: "Zanj Rebel Remnants in [aba_zanj_remnants_prov.GetAreaName]"
 abbasid_fitna.8.desc: "Some remnants of the Zanj Rebellion as well as slaves and freemen inspired by the cause have united to once against take up arms against our rule."

 abbasid_fitna.9.t: "Abbasid Soldiers Riot"
 abbasid_fitna.9.desc: "A group of soldiers in our own Abbasid army, seeing the disorder and chaos that has left them largely neglected by military leadership, have taken up our own arms against us and now riot against our rule."
 abbasid_fitna.9.a: "How dare they defy their superiors?"
 abbasid_fitna.10.t: "Kharijite Rebellion"
 abbasid_fitna.10.desc: "A regional dispute between a local dihqan and the administrators of the region has quickly escalated into a large-scale revolt of Kharijites, a militant Islamic sect that originated from supporters of Ali in the First Fitna. The Kharijites have pledged allegiance to this dihqan and have taken up arms against Abbasid rule across the realm. The rebels have already slain several hundred local Abbasid troops that were dispatched to deal with the revolt. Thus, it seems that this shall be a much greater challenge than we had originally anticipated."
 abbasid_fitna.10.a: "They shall be punished for their insolence!"
 abbasid_fitna.11.t: "Kharijite Rebel Leader Humiliated"
 abbasid_fitna.11.desc: "The rebel leaders of the Kharijite Rebellion have all been captured or killed, and the army commanders who saw success in battle against the rebels have been properly rewarded with robes of honor. Donning the robes, our generals rode in triumph throughout our capital of $CAPITAL_CITY$, and behind them trailed the captured rebel leaders. The commander of the rebels was placed atop an elephant in a woman's litter and was forced to wear humiliating clothing. Fortunately for him, his humiliation would not last very long, for the rebel commander and his subordinates were shortly after put to death by crucifixion."
 abbasid_fitna.11.a: "Let us hope this peace lasts"
 abbasid_fitna.12.t: "Advisor Assassinated!"
 abbasid_fitna.12.desc: "A trusted advisor of our Caliph has been mysteriously assassinated! With so many rival factions within and against the Caliphate, we are unsure of who to blame for their death. A longtime ally and confidant of our Caliph, there are many who mourn their death and the loss of their wisdom - though perhaps there are just as many who are secretly in celebration."
 abbasid_fitna.12.a: "Their wisdom shall not be forgotten..."

 byzantine_anarchy.1.a: "How dare they challenge our authority!"
 byzantine_anarchy.2.t: "End of the Anarchy"
 byzantine_anarchy.2.desc: "After much disorder, bloodshed and unrest, the period known as the Anarchy has been ended at last - all pretenders have been crushed; all rebellious armies have been decimated. While we have endured the constant civil wars and have therefore ensured the survival of the Roman Empire, there is still much work left to do in restoring peace and prosperity to our empire and its peoples so that none of our descendants shall ever have to face such times of troubles."

Dissatisfied with the current state and internal strife of the Eastern Roman Empire, the strategos in charge of the theme of Hellas has raised armies loyal to him against the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Although not necessarily claiming the throne for himself, the strategos and his forces have made it clear that they want nothing less than the death and replacement of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]."

While the strategos does not seem to desire the Roman throne himself, it seems that he will not tolerate [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] on the throne any longer. Thus, to restore peace and stability to the land, let us cross the isthmus of Corinth and put the rebels in their place."

The strategos of the theme of Makedonia along with other likeminded officers and regional troops have revolted against the  [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], calling for the deposition of  [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]  [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Using our own arms and armor against us and led by a skilled general, the rebellion must be crushed before it gets out of hand."

Defecting to the rebels, the troops have taken our heir to an unknown location. Although the rebels intend to kill them, such defectors are more than likely self-serving at heart - thus, perhaps we could negotiate the release of the heir should we open our treasury for the payment of a ransom."

Just as the opportunistic praetorian guard of old, it seems that our loyal troops may be more opportunistic and self-serving than we had hope. Paying out a bonus during such turbulent times to such a large army is much less than practical. Even so, refusing their demands in such a political climate of instability may result in less than ideal circumstances."
