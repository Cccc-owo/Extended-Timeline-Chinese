 dynasties.1.t:0 "The First Fitna Starts"
 dynasties.1.d:0 "For centuries, the Syrian and Mashriqi peoples have been enemies. Syrian mercenaries often times joined forces with Roman armies and fought against the Persians with their Mashriqi mercenaries. When Islam spread through the region, a message of open borders was spread which helped unify the conquering Caliphate. Now, however, this message is slowly being forgotten. Several Muslim tribes were not pleased by Ali being appointed as Caliph, most powerful of these tribes being the Umayyads. Mu'awiya, head of the Umayyads, had never been too fond of Ali, but after two of his loyal tribesmen, Talhah and Al-Zubayr were killed during the Battle of the Camel, he wished for revenge. The Syrian Muslims went on to murder 4000 suspected seditionists. Soon enough, Mu'awiya Umayyad revolted and wanted to not only seek the revenge that was properly due, but also conquer the Caliphate for himself. This started the first fitna, the first major civil war within the Islamic world."

Muawiyah Umayyad has now promised 'Amr ibn Al-'As the governorship of Egypt if the first fitna goes in the Umayyad favor. Obviously, 'Amr ibn Al-'As has joined the enemy."

 dynasties.3.d:0 "Aisha, Mother of the Believers, was Muhammad's youngest wife and the daughter of Abu Bakr. After Ali came into power, however, she has been concerned about the future of her tribe if Ali's followers remain in power. She ended up clashing with Ali's forces in the Battle of the Camel, where she was captured, but later released. How she sees Mu'awiya the more suitable ruler for the caliphate."

In the year 61AH, 680AD, he revolted after refusing to submit to the Umayyad rulers because he considered their grab for power illegitimate. The conflict culminated in the Battle of Karbala where Husayn and 71 of his followers were defeated and killed by 30,000 Umayyad soldiers. Becuase of this, the schism between Sunni and Shia was deepened as the Shia considered Husayn ibn Ali a martyr. In fact, the Day of Ashura is celebtrated each year to remember Husayn for his martyrdom."

 dynasties.9.t:0 "The Abbasid Revolution"
 dynasties.9.d:0 "The Abbasids were Arabs that descended from the youngest uncle of Muhammad, Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib. They viewed the Umayyads as illegitimate usurpers of the Islamic Caliphate. During the Umayyad Caliphate, the empire grew tremendously along with Islam. There were, however, many growing pains that came along with it. For starters, large parts of the Caliphate rejected Islam and stayed true to their original religion. These groups of people were often marginalized and looked down upon. Worse yet, non-arab muslims were treated the same way. Furthermore, Arab Muslims that lived outside the Arabian peninsula, such as settlers and soldiers, often felt displeased with the Caliphate for largly ignoring them. This caused massive unrest within the Umayyad Caliphate and a large number of people began to back the Abbasids as the true Caliphs of Islam. Now, Abu al-Abbas as-Saffah has begun the Abbasid Revolution, aiming to bring him and his family to power."

Soon after, he showed incredible ability in politics, persuading Shias, Sunnis, Zoroastrians, Jews, and Christians to rally under him. After being appointed governer of Syria and Egypt by the Umayyads, he continued to grow in power. Not pleased with his gain of influence, the Umayyad Caliphate attempted to assassinate Abu Muslim, to which he responded by fully supporting the Abbasids' claim on the throne."

 dynasties.13.t:0 "Debate to End Arabization"
 dynasties.13.d:0 "During the Abbasid Revolution, a debate was sparked amongst the leading Arab aristocracy.

Now, the elite of our nation have begun to wonder if accepting more heathens into our ranks would be beneficial. It would destabalize our realm in the short term, but help out by lowering support for the Abbasid pretenders."

With this, the Umayyad Caliphate ended and the Abbasid Caliphate began. Across the next few centuries, the Abbasid Caliphate would make room for Islam's Golden Age, developing literature, math, and science greatly. Baghdad would become the center of the world and continue to be a marvel of its time until the sacking of it by the Mongols in the mid 13th century. Although Arabic continued to be the main language of government, many local provinces had cultural and religious freedom, decreasin unrest throughout the empire.

Finally, in 777 Abd ar-Rahmān ibn Rustam, who was one of the four original missionaries, was elected Imam. Unlike other Ibadi Imamets, this Imamete was hereditary. The justification was that Abd ar-Rahmān ibn Rustam came from no tribe, being of Persian descent, and thus would show no biase towards any of the Berber tribes in the area.
