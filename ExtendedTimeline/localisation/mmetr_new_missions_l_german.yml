 #UMA Umayyad Caliphate
 uma_continue_expansion_mission_title: "Continue Expansion"
 uma_continue_expansion_mission_desc: "Though the expansion of the Islamic faith was temporarily halted by the civil war of the First Fitna, we of the Umayyad clan have emerged as the sole and true heirs to the Caliphate. Thus, with stability restored in the Muslim realm, let us continue our holy war to expand far beyond the Islamic heartland." 
 uma_secure_ifriqiyah_mission_title: "Secure Ifriqiyah"
 uma_secure_ifriqiyah_mission_desc: "The Roman provincia of Africa, established since the fall of Carthage to the Roman Republic many centuries ago, is home to a breadbasket coveted by all. Thus, let us seize Ifriqiya for ourselves and establish our own province so we may expand our faith and exert our influence over the Berbers."
 uma_berber_diplomacy_mission_title: "Berber Diplomacy"
 uma_berber_diplomacy_mission_desc: "While we have the martial might to expand further westward across the Maghreb, it will all be for naught should be never win the allegiance of the newly conquered. Thus, let us establish a firm military presence in the region as well as ally with Berber tribal leaders who may serve as our ambassadors in gathering and levying Berber soldiers for our future campaigns."
 uma_conquest_al_andalus_mission_title: "Conquer Al-Andalus"
 uma_conquest_al_andalus_mission_desc: "The kingdom of the Visigoths have recently begun falling into decline. With the kings no longer recognized as the true rulers of Hispania by the Iberian peoples as well as fellow Goths, there are even some Visigoth nobles who are inviting we Umayyads to liberate them from the cruel and incapable rule of the Visigothic kings. Thus, let us not allow their calls to fall on deaf ears - let us liberate Iberia!"
 uma_andalusian_administration_mission_title: "Andalusian Administration"
 uma_andalusian_administration_mission_desc: "Though we have conquered the vast realm of Al-Andalus, we will need an efficient and strong local government to keep it all in order. Thus, let us place a loyal governor of the Umayyads in the new regional capital of Qurtuba who shall rule the Iberians on our behalf."
 uma_cross_the_pyrenees_mission_title: "Cross the Pyrenees"
 uma_cross_the_pyrenees_mission_desc: "With all of Al-Andalus under stable Umayyad rule, the time has come to set our eyes upon the lands beyond the Pyrenees Mountains. Let us advance further north and challenge the Franks so we may spread the word of the one true faith in lands far from our homelands of Arabia and Syria."
 uma_defeat_franks_mission_title: "Vanquish the Franks"
 uma_defeat_franks_mission_desc: "Since we seized the realm of Andalusia, the kingdom of the Franks have been our fiercest rivals next to the Romans in Constantinople. Thus, with the unstoppable momentum we have possessed since our victories in Aquitaine, let us continue our northern advance and acquire even more Frankish subjects under Umayyad rule."
 uma_establish_barid_mission_title: "Establish the Barid"
 uma_establish_barid_mission_desc: "The Islamic Caliphate has grown incredibly rapidly, beginning with the holy war in Arabia and now spanning from Africa to Persia following the conquest of Roman and Sassanid lands. Thus, our empire needs a vast postal service so there may be better and more efficient communication across the realm."
 uma_march_to_ferghana_mission_title: "March to Samarkand"
 uma_march_to_ferghana_mission_desc: "The lands along our frontier in Sogdia are home to many heathen religions that contradict the word of God. Thus, let us continue our holy war in the direction of Samarkand so we may spread the word of the one true God to a land that is ignorant of it."
 uma_destroy_fire_temples_mission_title: "Destroy the Fire Temples"
 uma_destroy_fire_temples_mission_desc: "Though we accept the People of the Book, Christians and Jews, under our empire, we have little tolerance for those who do not share our worship of the one true God. Thus, let us dismantle the heathen temples and build mosques atop the rubble in lands far from the Muslim heartland."
 uma_sway_iranians_mission_title: "Sway the Persians"
 uma_sway_iranians_mission_desc: "The Persians have resented us Arabs since the fall of the Sassanid Empire at the hands of the Caliphate many years ago. Many of them continue to clutch onto their false god and slander us in their texts. Even those who have converted to Islam long for the days in which they themselves were the ruling class. If they will not become loyal, then let us sway them through show of might and valor to prevent any potential rebellion."
 uma_convert_persia_mission_title: "Convert Persia"
 uma_convert_persia_mission_desc: "Many in Persia remain tied to the old heathen faith of Zoroastrianism. Although the local governors may be against conversion of the region thanks to the lucrative tax imposed on non-Muslims, we should at least aim to convert the Persians who are willing to become enlightened of the one true faith."
 uma_arabize_persia_mission_title: "Arabize Persia"
 uma_arabize_persia_mission_desc: "Under the Umayyad Caliphate, one's status as a Muslim is tied to one's Arab background. Since the Persians cling so hard to their culture and traditions and reject those of our own, let us pursue a policy of Arabization by imposing the Arab language and culture on the Persian people."
 uma_pacify_goths_mission_title: "Pacify the Visigoths"
 uma_pacify_goths_mission_desc: "Though some of the Visigoth aristocracy welcomed our rule in Andalusia, there are still many of the former Visigoth ruling class who have not accepted our rule. Thus, let us redistribute land back to the Christian Visigoths to prevent any major revolt by assuring them of their right to keep their holdings."
 uma_consolidate_the_caliphate_mission_title: "Consolidate the Caliphate"
 uma_consolidate_the_caliphate_mission_desc: "The First Fitna saw a great civil war in which our Umayyad dynasty prevailed. Many enemies wish for our demise; some of these enemies rule neighboring states, like the Romans, while other enemies live even within our own realm, such as the Kharijites. Thus, let us remain vigilant in reestablishing order in the Caliphate and consolidating our position as the true holders of the title of Caliph."
 uma_qudaa_allies_mission_title: "Quda'a Alliance"
 uma_qudaa_allies_mission_desc: "The Quda'a confederation in Syria, led by the influential Banu Kalb tribe, make up most of the Umayyad central powerbase. Our dynasty's founder Mu'awiya served in the governorship of Syria before his rise as Caliph, establishing strong ties with local tribes like the Quda'a. Thus, it is important that we maintain these strong ties so we will always have loyal subjects to call upon in times of trouble."
 uma_appease_the_clans_mission_title: "Appease the Clans"
 uma_appease_the_clans_mission_desc: "The relocation of the Caliphate's capital to Syria following the rise of our dynasty along with the strong ties of friendship we have built with the Quda'a clans in Syria have caused resentment among the noble Arab families in Arabia and Iraq who feel left out. Thus, let us reach out to these clans and appease them to avoid any widespread disloyalty."
 uma_integrate_mawali_mission_title: "Integrate the Mawali"
 uma_integrate_mawali_mission_desc: "The mawali, non-Arabs who converted to Islam under our rule, have not been fully integrated into our society. While we still wish to prioritize and favor those descending from the prestigious Arab tribes, we must consider fully accepting these mawali if we wish to avoid any future conflict with non-Arabs in the Caliphate."
 uma_unify_the_community_mission_title: "Unify the Community"
 uma_unify_the_community_mission_desc: "The Ummah, the Muslim community, was deeply divided following the divisive outcome of the First Fitna, in which we Umayyads emerged as the victor. The followers of Ali and other groups such as the Kharijites continued to oppose our rule despite our clear inheritance of the title of Caliph. Thus, we must take further steps in mending these schisms and uniting the Ummah once more."
 uma_rule_the_sea_mission_title: "Rule the Sea"
 uma_rule_the_sea_mission_desc: "The Caliphate has been primarily an unstoppable powerhouse on land. Thus, it is time that we expand our horizons, and our navy, to project the power and influence of the Caliphate across the vast Mediterranean Sea. The arrogant Romans had once called the sea Mare Nostrum, 'Our Sea' - let us make the sea ours instead."
 uma_develop_dimashq_mission_title: "Develop Dimashq"
 uma_develop_dimashq_mission_desc: "The city of Damascus has served as the Umayyad capital since the governorship of our founder Mu'awiya under the Rashidun Caliphate. As the new seat of the Caliph, it is imperative that we develop the city into a religious, cultural and economic center of the empire."
 uma_syrian_metropolis_mission_title: "Syrian Metropolis"
 uma_syrian_metropolis_mission_desc: "With the expansion of the capital of Dimashq in Syria, the time has now come to invest in the development and urbanization of Syria as a whole. We have many allied clans and tribes in the region, and we would benefit from investing in their lands with the state treasury."
 uma_alid_negotiations_mission_title: "Alid Negotiations"
 uma_alid_negotiations_mission_desc: "The Alids, supporters of the fourth Rashidun Caliph Ali, have despised we Umayyads since the Islamic civil war of the First Fitna. While it would be impossible to fully silence them or win them over, perhaps some middle ground can be found through negotiations with the more moderate Alids. Eventually, we must mend this schism between the two factions, or we shall face destruction from within."
 uma_placate_dhimmi_mission_title: "Placate the Dhimmi"
 uma_placate_dhimmi_mission_desc: "The dhimmi are a protected class under the Caliphate. Christians and Jews are made dhimmi, given rights and protections for still following God as People of the Book. However, the dhimmi are still a separated class in our society. Thus, by appealing to these misguided followers of God, we can guarantee their integration into the Caliphate as loyal subjects of the Caliph and God Himself."
 uma_dhimmi_traders_mission_title: "Dhimmi Traders"
 uma_dhimmi_traders_mission_desc: "Besides the revenue generated from the jizya tax, the dhimmi in our realm present us with more opportunities for filling our treasury through trade. Many of the Christian and Jewish dhimmi in our lands have extensive trade ties across the world, and it would be a waste if we did not benefit from such well-established trade networks."
 uma_root_out_kharijites_mission_title: "Root Out Kharijites"
 uma_root_out_kharijites_mission_desc: "Ever since the First Fitna, the followers of the Kharijite sect of Islam have opposed our rule, especially the militant Kharijite schools. Since we do not recognize them as true followers of God, it is important that we keep them in check. Thus, should we provoke them to come out of hiding, we would be able to crush the Kharijite threat in one decisive blow."
 uma_root_out_kharijites_mission.tt: "Trigger an event that §RSpawns Kharijite Zealot rebels§! in the §YBahrain area§!\nDefeating these rebels will grant §Ybonuses§! in the next mission, 'Defeat the Kharijites'"
 uma_defeat_the_kharijites_mission_title: "Defeat the Kharijites"
 uma_defeat_the_kharijites_mission_desc: "By rooting out and defeating the Kharijites in pitched battle, we can obtain greater religious unity and stability in the realm, with all subjects under the one true Caliph."
 uma_defeat_the_kharijites_mission.tt: "Have had Kharijite rebels spawn from previous mission's event"
 uma_control_indus_mission_title: "Control the Indus"
 uma_control_indus_mission_desc: "The Indus River sits along the frontier of our state. Controlling the river would be beneficial for our trade profits as well as provide us a foothold in India, from which we can launch further campaigns deeper into the Indian heartland to spread the word of God."
 uma_invade_hindustan_mission_title: "Invade Hindustan"
 uma_invade_hindustan_mission_desc: "The pagan kingdoms of India continue to resist our advances. Let us conduct a full-scale invasion of the Hindu lands so we may spread the word of the one true God."
 uma_avert_a_second_fitna_mission_title: "Avert a Second Fitna"
 uma_avert_a_second_fitna_mission_desc: "Although we Umayyads emerged victorious in the civil war of the First Fitna, it would be wise for us to take any means necessary to avoid a Second Fitna that will threaten the very existence of Umayyad rule in the Caliphate."
 uma_crush_the_revolution_mission_title: "Crush the Revolution"
 uma_crush_the_revolution_mission_desc: "There are many mawali, non-Arab followers of Islam, who resent the high status that Arabs and descendants of prestigious Arab tribes hold in Umayyad society. Thus, should any of them raise up arms against the Caliph, we must do all we can to crush their resistance."
 uma_legacy_of_uthman_mission_title: "Legacy of Uthman"
 uma_legacy_of_uthman_mission_desc: "The third Caliph of the Rashidun, Uthman, hailed from the Umayyad clan. He greatly expanded the Caliphate and established institutions still used by his descendants to this day; most importantly, his influence allowed for the rise of the Umayyad clan in becoming the permanant line of Caliphs in the realm. Thus, let us prove ourselves worthy successors of Uthman through our martial might."
 uma_push_back_the_romans_mission_title: "Push Back the Romans"
 uma_push_back_the_romans_mission_desc: "When the Islamic conquests began, the Rashidun Caliphs were backed by the full glorious power of God, completely conquering the mighty Persian Empire and taking much of the Romans' lands in the east. With our position in Syria and Egypt consolidated, let us continue our campaigns against the Romans and push them back from Anatolia."
 uma_besiege_al_qustantiniyya_mission_title: "Besiege Al- Qustantiniyya"
 uma_besiege_al_qustantiniyya_mission_desc: "Constantinople has been the City of the World's Desire since the city of Byzantium's expansion and transformation into Constantinople by Emperor Constantine himself. Thus, let us prove to the Christian Romans our full backing from God by laying siege to the city of Constantine and taking their magnificent city from them."
 uma_caliph_of_rome_mission_title: "A Caliph of Romans"
 uma_caliph_of_rome_mission_desc: "The splendid Hagia Sophia built by the Roman emperors is an architectural and religious marvel. Thus, as common worshippers of God, it would only make sense for us to convert the Hagia Sophia into a great mosque worthy of receiving God's grace. Turning Constantinople into a distinctly Muslim and Arab city would also greatly help us in consolidating our position as the new holy leaders of our Roman subjects."
 uma_invasion_of_italy_mission_title: "Invasion of Italy"
 uma_invasion_of_italy_mission_desc: "With the city of Constantinople under full control of the Caliphate, and even converted to the true faith, we now have the preparations for conducting an invasion of Italy. As the spritual successor to the Romans as the undisputed holy leader under the one true God, it is time we take the Roman homeland to unite the Christian and Muslim spheres under the Caliphate once and for all."
 uma_people_of_god_united_mission_title: "People of God United"
 uma_people_of_god_united_mission_desc: "Our victory over the Romans and the Christian armies of the Franks have proven to all the superiority of our armies as well as the fact that God has chosen us as his true representatives and believers. Thus, let us unite all of the People of the Book under one banner, indivisible under God."
 uma_people_of_god_united_mission.tt: "Own or non-tributary subjects own every province in the world that is Christian, Muslim or Jewish"
 
 #EGY Ayyubid Egypt
 egy_war_for_unification_mission_title: "War for Unification"
 egy_war_for_unification_mission_desc: "Saladin himself despised bloodshed unless it was absolutely necessary. One of the primary motives for Saladin's rise to power was the unification of Muslims against the common threat of the Christian Crusaders. The goal remains the same today, and we shall therefore raise our armies not for the purpose of spilling blood, but for the purpose of uniting the Muslim realm against the foreign invaders."
 egy_consolidate_hadramawt_mission_title: "Consolidate Hadramawt"
 egy_consolidate_hadramawt_mission_desc: "Saladin expanded towards southern Arabia and secured the lands of Yemen in order to gain control of the gate of entry for merchants ships entering the Red Sea, therefore profiting from the Red Sea trade. Let us consolidate our hold over southern Arabia by securing Hadramawt's loyalty to the Ayyubid kingdom."
 egy_red_sea_trade_mission_title: "Red Sea Investments"
 egy_red_sea_trade_mission_desc: "The Red Sea is a lucrative region for trade, being one of few links between India and the Mediterranean. Though Saladin established cordial trade relations with the Europeans, he never allowed them access to the Indian trade in the Red Sea, creating an Ayyubid monopoly of trade with India. Thus, let us continue profiting from the Red Sea trade by building facilities along the trade routes to direct merchants in the direction of the Red Sea, such as the trade stop of Yanbu in the Hejaz."
 egy_expand_into_nubia_mission_title: "Question of the Baqt"
 egy_expand_into_nubia_mission_desc: "Hundreds of years ago, the Nubians of Makuria and the Muslim rulers of Egypt signed the Baqt treaty, ensuring peace between the Muslim world and the Christian lands of Nubia. However, the great threat of the Christian crusaders has backed us into a corner, and if we must expand in order to strengthen ourselves to face the foreign invaders, perhaps some honor must be discarded and the treaty annulled in order for us to consolidate our holdings in Upper Egypt..."
 egy_control_jerusalem_mission_title: "Control Jerusalem"
 egy_control_jerusalem_mission_desc: "Ever since the Christian's first holy war for Jerusalem, the city has been a hot point of contention between the Islamic and Christian powers. While the Christians launched their first crusade when the Islamic frontier was divided between the Sunni Seljuks and the Shiite Fatimids, we Ayyubids have overthrown the Fatimids and united the western coast under Sunni Islam. Thus, let us use this new Islamic unity to secure Jerusalem once and for all."
 egy_control_jerusalem_mission.tt: "Gain permanent claims on all Christian-owned lands in the §YMashriq§! region"
 egy_defeat_the_crusaders_mission_title: "Defeat the Crusaders"
 egy_defeat_the_crusaders_mission_desc: "While we have warred on and off with the Crusader States in the past, it has become increasingly clear that peace cannot last forever should the hostile invaders remain in our lands. Thus, let us drive the foreign invaders from our home and return the holy lands to the true believers."
 egy_return_of_christians_mission_title: "Return of Christians"
 egy_return_of_christians_mission_desc: "Saladin was well respected in both the Islamic and Christian worlds for his magnanimous treatment of Christian soldiers and civilians alike when warring with the crusaders. Thus, let us follow his example and ensure the safe passage of Christians back to their homes in Europe, which will also allow us to repopulate these lands with fellow Muslim brothers and sisters."
 egy_return_of_christians_mission.tt: "One province with the most development in the Palestine, Syria or Aleppo areas changes to your own religion\nOne Catholic country with at least 90 opinion of us gains §G1§! base tax for accepting the Christian refugees"
 egy_return_of_christians_mission.tt2: "Is Catholic and has at least 90 opinion of us"
 egy_reconquest_of_sicily_mission_title: "Reconquest of Sicily"
 egy_reconquest_of_sicily_mission_desc: "The Muslim emirate of Sicily was conquered by the Normans over a century ago, and it has been under Christian rule ever since. With our expanded influence across the Mediterranean as well as our trade ties with European powers, perhaps now is a good time to retake the island, both as a strategic naval foothold as well as retribution for our Muslim brothers in Sicily."
 egy_defender_of_islam_mission_title: "Defender of Islam"
 egy_defender_of_islam_mission_desc: "Saladin rose to power in Egypt and expanded into Syria with the intention of uniting Islam against the Christian invaders. Thus, with the Abbasid Caliph's realm much smaller than it used to be, perhaps it is time for the Ayyubid family to take up the title of Defender of Islam."
 egy_unite_the_arab_states_mission_title: "Unite the Arab Clans"
 egy_unite_the_arab_states_mission_desc: "Since the Abbasid Caliphate declined in power, numerous independent dynasties emerged in the Arabian homeland, all vying for power in the vacuum left by the Abbasid decline. As the new servants of the one true Sunni Caliph, let us take up the task of unifying all influential clans of Arabia proper under Ayyubid, and therefore the Caliph's, rule."
 egy_bahraini_trade_links_mission_title: "Bahraini Trade Links"
 egy_bahraini_trade_links_mission_desc: "Though eclipsed in the past by more lucrative trading sites, the region of Bahrain has grown significantly in influence and wealth in regard to trade with India. With the unification of the Arabian peninsula, let us exert greater influence in the region to increase our profits from the eastern trade."
 egy_tripoli_and_cyrenaica_mission_title: "Tripoli and Cyrenaica"
 egy_tripoli_and_cyrenaica_mission_desc: "The Almohads to the west are a growing threat, and they have begun to gain influence over the Mamluks in Cyrenaica and Tripolitania who had sworn allegiance to us. To ensure that the Mamluks shall remain loyal to us and not defect to the Almohad, let us make sure that those in Cyrenaica and Tripolitania know who they should answer to."
 egy_challenge_the_almohads_mission_title: "Challenge the Almohads"
 egy_challenge_the_almohads_mission_desc: "The Almohads in Morocco claim the title of Caliph, yet it is clear to us, servants of the Caliphs in Baghdad, that the Almohads have absolutely no legitimacy in doing so. Since the Almohads directly challenge the true Caliph in Baghdad, let us in turn challenge the authority of the Almohads in a contest of martial might."
 egy_restore_jerusalem_mission_title: "Restore Jerusalem"
 egy_restore_jerusalem_mission_desc: "The city of Jerusalem was home to many splendid works of architecture and art dating back to the Caliphates of the Rashidun and Umayyad before they were desecrated by the Christian invaders. With Jerusalem firmly secured and safe under our rule, let us restore the Muslim architecture and infrastructure of the holy city."
 egy_italian_merchants_mission_title: "Italian Merchants"
 egy_italian_merchants_mission_desc: "Though the Italian traders were allies with the crusaders in their invasions of our homeland, the Italian merchants have also made it clear that they are open to establishing friendly trade relations with us for our mutual benefit and profit. Thus, as we despise bloodshed, let us extend a hand in earnest friendship to the Italian merchants."
 egy_expand_indian_trade_mission_title: "Expand Indian Trade"
 egy_expand_indian_trade_mission_desc: "Now that we control several key trading points across Arabia and the surrounding regions, we now have the foundation to expand our investment and engagement in the lucrative Indian trade as middlemen between the far east and the far west."
 egy_united_islamic_front_mission_title: "United Islamic Front"
 egy_united_islamic_front_mission_desc: "If we wish to unite Islam in the face of foreign invaders, we must make clear our noble and righteous goal to all of the world as well as our own subjects. We can make our message loud and clear by establishing a great and mighty Muslim army capable of defending against the fiercest of Christian invaders."
 egy_fealty_of_the_clans_mission_title: "Fealty of the Clans"
 egy_fealty_of_the_clans_mission_desc: "Saladin won the hearts of those he conquered by defeating them in battle and, instead of punishing them, freeing them from prison and even giving them gifts before sending them back to their realms to serve as Saladin’s subjects. Though they praised Saladin’s magnanimity, their descendants may not remember the kindness of us Ayyubids - even the Ayyubid households ruling domains across our lands may not remain loyal. Thus, let us take further steps in ensuring the clans serving as local rulers under our state do not forget this kindness and turn against us."
 egy_fealty_of_the_clans_mission.tt: "Ayyubid Favors"
 egy_ally_the_assassins_mission_title: "Ally the Assassins"
 egy_ally_the_assassins_mission_desc: "The Nizari Isma'ili Assassins are a great threat to Muslim and Christian rulers alike in Syria. Though the Order of Assassins has been a constant threat to Ayyubid rulers since the dynasty's founding, the shadowy nature of the Assassins makes them very difficult and risky to eliminate without swift retaliation from the skilled Assassins. Thus, it may be mutually beneficial to instead seek common ground and form an alliance with the Assassins."
 egy_ally_the_assassins_mission.tt: "Have the option to grant Hamah to the §YHashashin§! as a §YMarch§!"
 egy_sunni_egypt_mission_title: "Sunni Egypt"
 egy_sunni_egypt_mission_desc: "The Shia Fatimid dynasty claimed the title of Caliph and established themselves in Cairo as a direct challenge to the authority of the Sunni Caliph. Although Saladin had overthrown the Fatimids and established a Sunni kingdom loyal to the Baghdad Caliph in its place, the legacy of the Shia Fatimids in Egypt remains. Thus, just as we had restored Sunni rule in Egypt, let us lead the misguided back into true believers of God."
 egy_sunni_egypt_mission.tt: "All owned provinces that are in the §YEgypt§! region follow our primary religion"
 egy_custodian_of_two_mosques_mission_title: "Custodian of Two Mosques"
 egy_custodian_of_two_mosques_mission_desc: "Our founder, the great Saladin, was named the Custodian of the Two Mosques, referring to the two mosques of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. As the first non-Caliph ruler to serve as protector of the two holiest sites in Islam, it is of great importance that we earn our title as Custodian and ensure the cities are safe for pilgrims from all around the world."
 egy_amir_al_hajj_mission_title: "Amir Al-Hajj"
 egy_amir_al_hajj_mission_desc: "Though the cities of Mecca and Medina are the destination of Hajj pilgrims from across the Islamic world, the devout are not safe from greedy and vile bandits who wish to target the vulnerable pilgrims. Thus, let us formally establish a commander in charge of defending the Hajj pilgrims, the Amir al-Hajj."
 egy_defensive_fleet_mission_title: "Defensive Fleet"
 egy_defensive_fleet_mission_desc: "The vile crusader Reynauld of Chatillon outrageously dispatched a fleet to destroy and desecrate the holy sites of Mecca and Medina. Though the fleet was intercepted in the Red Sea by Saladin's forces, who knows when a contemptuous individual like Reynauld will attempt to target our holiest sites once more. Thus, let us establish a fleet for the purpose of defending the seas under our protection and bring further security to the true followers of God."
 egy_client_in_hormuz_mission_title: "The Wealth of Hormuz"
 egy_client_in_hormuz_mission_desc: "The island of Hormuz is another profitable trade stop between India and Persia. It has gained attention from many great empires thanks to its wealth. Thus, we would benefit from bringing the island of Hormuz as well as the lands surrounding the Strait of Hormuz under our rule, as well as building relations with the local merchants to ensure we benefit from their business."
 egy_ayyubid_fortifications_mission_title: "Ayyubid Fortifications"
 egy_ayyubid_fortifications_mission_desc: "It must be admitted that we have learned much about the art of fortification from our enemies, the Crusaders and the Fatimids. We can strengthen the defenses of our realm using these designs, such as the Crusaders' curtain walls and the Fatimid's rounded towers with machicolations, openings for dropping projectiles on enemies from above."
 egy_sunni_madrasa_mission_title: "Sunni Madrasas"
 egy_sunni_madrasa_mission_desc: "As we continue to consolidate the position of Sunni Islam in Egypt and Syria, it is imperative that Islamic scholarship is allowed to flourish in peace once more after a long period of internal strife. Thus, let us build madrasas, religious institutions serving as schools of Islamic law. Although our ruler follows but one school of Islam, let us construct colleges from all four major schools of Sunni Islam so that all Sunni Muslims may feel welcome under our rule."
 egy_patron_of_medicine_mission_title: "Patron of Medicine"
 egy_patron_of_medicine_mission_desc: "In emulation of the Al-Nuri Hospital built in Damascus by the great emir and general Nur-al-Din, let us construct hospitals, hospices and institutions of medicine across the realm, starting with Cairo, the central city of Egypt."
 egy_ayyubid_cities_mission_title: "Ayyubid Cities"
 egy_ayyubid_cities_mission_desc: "With the development of Ayyubid infrastructure across all of our realm, the time has come to make it so that every one of our major cities has the ability to stand as preeminent economic and cultural centers of the Islamic world."
 egy_finish_off_east_seljuks_mission_title: "The Seljuks of Hamadan"
 egy_finish_off_east_seljuks_mission_desc: "The Seljuk sultans of Hamadan continue to rule in Persia to the east, far from their Anatolian counterparts of the Seljuk sultanate of Rum. Surrounded by the growing power of the Khwarezmians, perhaps it would be wise for us to preemptively seize the remaining Seljuk domains in Persia for the Abbasid Caliphate before they fall into the hands of other ambitious powers."
 egy_challenge_the_khwarezmids_mission_title: "Challenge Khwarezmids"
 egy_challenge_the_khwarezmids_mission_desc: "The Anushteginid dynasty of Khwarezmia has greatly expanded, seizing large quantities of land across Persia. We are certain that the ambitious Khwarezmids eye the Caliphate capital of Baghdad with hungry eyes. Thus, let us send our armies to challenge the Khwarezmids and protect the Caliph's borders in the east."
 egy_roman_alliance_mission_title: "Roman Alliance"
 egy_roman_alliance_mission_desc: "Though the Roman Empire in Constantinople is Christian like the crusaders who devastated our land and people, they are a different stock of Christian and have had many quarrels with the crusaders in the past. We have even heard reports of the crusaders attacking and sacking Roman cities in Anatolia and Greece. Thus, perhaps we may be able to establish goodwill with the Roman emperor and find a common enemy in the rampaging crusaders of the Franks."
 egy_ally_the_caliphate_mission_title: "Ally the Caliphate"
 egy_ally_the_caliphate_mission_desc: "Saladin emerged from obscurity and overthrew the Fatimid Caliph in Egypt with the purpose of establishing Sunni Islam in Egypt and serving the Abbasid Caliph of Baghdad. Thus, let us build a strong bond of rapport between subject and Caliph, and let us assure the Caliph that we hold no such ambitions of exerting influence over them like the Seljuks had not too long ago."
 egy_guardian_of_the_caliph_mission_title: "Guardian of the Caliph"
 egy_guardian_of_the_caliph_mission_desc: "Though the Abbasid Caliphate has recently regained some of the military power they held in Baghdad long ago, it is becoming clearer to all that it will be increasingly difficult for the Caliph to defend himself on his own as ambitious and powerful rulers rise all around Baghdad. Thus, perhaps it is time for us to formally place the Caliph in Baghdad under our protection, while still making it clear that we are the subjects and the Caliph is the leader of Islam."

 egy_seljuks_of_rum_mission_desc: "We have served as mediators for the Seljuks of Rum in the past. Even so, their continued aggression against fellow Muslim states is concerning, as it could pose a major obstacle in the way of unity under the Ayyubid and Abbasid banners. Thus, perhaps it would be wise to compel the surrender of the Seljuk sultan."

 ita_diplomats_to_constantinople_mission_desc: "The Germanic foederati leader Odoacer seized Ravenna, compelling the last Western Roman emperor Romulus Augustus to step down. However, this does not inherently make us an enemy of the Romans; by sending a diplomat representing the Senate, we can request for the Roman emperor in Constantinople to recognize the German ruler of Italy as the new governor and patrician of Italy. Such a move would ensure some level of peace between us and the Romans in Constantinople as well as refute the legitimacy of the Western Roman pretenders in Dalmatia."

 ita_gallo_roman_pretenders_mission_desc: "The Gallic pretenders of the kingdom of the Soissons claim the legitimacy of West Rome, yet they do not hold even a single territory in Italia.

Thus, the Ostrogoths pose a great threat to us due to their power base, their close proximity to our realm, and their connections of kinship with the powerful Visigoths in the west.

 ita_set_sail_for_britannia_mission_title: "Set Sail for Britain"
 ita_set_sail_for_britannia_mission_desc: "The Roman conquest of Britain was more of a display of martial might than a necessity, as the lands of Britain were the first of Rome's territories to be abandoned as the western empire crumbled from within. Thus, reconquering the lands of Britannia is not of major importance to us. However, should we ever stabilize our new empire and find ourselves armed for further expansion, let us sail across the seas and display our martial might through the reconquest of Briton lands."

Having marched into Italy and seized Ravenna from the last true emperor of Western Rome, we are now officially governors of Rome, subject to the Roman emperor in Constantinople.

The people of Africa have been under Germanic rule for a very long time, as the Vandals had seized the province quite some time before the western empire fell.

 ita_odoacer_trustworthy_allies_mission_title: "Trustworthy Allies"
 ita_odoacer_trustworthy_allies_mission_desc: "Although we have become the official governors of Italy, the utter collapse of the western half of the Roman Empire has led to great instability and the rise of many warring kingdoms led by fellow Germans.

 ita_subjugate_the_rugii_mission_desc: "Looking around us, there are few lands left in the former Western Roman Empire that are not owned by fellow Germanics.

Coinage is one way in which we can project our influence within and beyond our realm, spreading the face of our great ruler far and wide.

Once faithful Zoroastrians, the Osroenians have since turned to the rising religion of Christianity. Rule of the land had also changed hands from the Parthians to the Romans. As former Zoroastrian and Parthian land, it is our right to take back the lands of Osroene as servants the true faith of Ahura Mazda.

Thus, let us prove to the world that we are indeed the King of Kings by subjugating all foreign kings who wish to defy our divine authority given to us by Ahura Mazda."

Thus, let us invest our state funds directly into the Academy and invite the finest scholarly minds from across the realm, whether they be Persian, Greek, or from any other foreign culture or religion."

 sas_sasanian_splendor_mission_desc: "'Khwarrah' is the divine glory and splendor bestowed upon the kings chosen by Ahura Mazda as noted in the Avesta. Because kings are granted khwarrah based on their righteousness and piety, a king would also quickly lose the khwarrah should he ever become cruel and tyrranical, and another worthy king would be chosen and granted the khwarrah in his place. Our fortunes and the prosperity of our subjects has proven to all that we are the true holders of khwarrah; thus, let us work hard to prove to Ahura Mazda that we are deserving of the divine glory by continuining to grow the wealth and prosperity of our rule."

 sas_control_the_caucasus_mission_title: "Control the Caucasus"
 sas_control_the_caucasus_mission_desc: "The lands of the Caucasus are the ideal border for any rising empire. Easily defensible due to its natural geography, its great mountains and strategically-vital passes, we would greatly benefit from acquiring the Caucasus for ourselves. Additionally, the marzbans, frontier governors, of Sasanian lands are often granted special privileges so they may defend our borders loyally; should we seize the Caucasus, the marzban there shall surely receive only the most splendid of privileges - perhaps a golden throne?"
 sas_secure_palestine_mission_title: "Secure Palestina"
 sas_secure_palestine_mission_desc: "The lands of Palestine are our main gateway into the rich and prized lands of Egypt and the Nile. Thus, if we wish to restore the glory of the Persians and place Egypt under Persian rule once more, we will need to establish firm control over the lands of Syria Palaestina."
 sas_invasion_of_egypt_mission_title: "Invasion of Egypt"
 sas_invasion_of_egypt_mission_desc: "The lands of Egypt are Rome's second most productive breadbasket - before the Romans rebuilt Carthage, it had been their main source of grain. Such a rich and prosperous land would be wasted under the control of our Roman rivals. With the Syrian and Palestine coasts brought under Sasanian control, the time has now come to march south to Egypt and return the fertile lands of the Nile to Persian rule once more."
 sas_here_to_stay_mission_title: "Here to Stay"
 sas_here_to_stay_mission_desc: "The lands of Egypt have changed hands many times throughout the course of history, and it has been centuries since its people have known independence. They were subjugated by the Achaemenid Persian Empire; then, by the Hellenistic kings Alexander and Ptolemy; then, by the Romans. Now, they are under our direct rule. Thus, let us win the hearts of the Egyptians and show them that our ruling dynasty is here to stay in Egypt."

 van_sack_of_rome_mission_desc: "The eternal city of Rome has become a shadow of it former self; the fact that we Germans can so easily march across their lands is a testament of the Roman's decline. Thus, let us take advantage of the chaos consuming the Roman Empire and directly besiege the city of Rome itself, plundering all of its riches to fill our Vandal coffers back home."

 van_vandal_rule_in_hispalis_mission_desc: "Hispania is home to many riches, something that we Vandals are especially interested in obtaining. Thus, in these uncertain times, perhaps we would benefit from migrating towards a new home in the Roman provinciae of Hispania and claiming some of the more prosperous areas of the region for ourselves."
 van_carthago_nova_mission_title: "Carthago Nova"
 van_carthago_nova_mission_desc: "The city of Carthago Nova was a former center of the Carthaginians, inherited by the Romans following the Punic Wars. It continues to be a prominent trading city in Hispania, and is therefore the source of much of Hispania's wealth from commerce. Thus, let us seize the city itself to establish a trading position along the coast."
 van_rule_hispania_mission_title: "Rule Hispania"
 van_rule_hispania_mission_desc: "As the Roman's hold over its farther reaches of the empire continue to deteriorate, Hispania becomes increasingly ripe for the picking. Thus, let us continue to campaign in Hispania to expand our kingdom, and subjugate any Romans, Iberians, or fellow Germans who wish to stand in the way of our ambitions."

 van_mare_nostrum_mission_desc: "To the Romans, the Mediterranean Sea is known as 'Mare Nostrum,' meaning 'Our Sea.' The Romans have long monopolized the Mediterranean and all of its shores, and it would be nothing less than humiliating for the Romans to lose what they have long and arrogantly called their very own sea - perhaps we shall be the ones to seize the Mediterranean for ourselves as our very own 'Mare Nostrum.'"

 van_arianism_triumphs_mission_desc: "The ideas and doctrine of Arian were rejected and condemned as heresy by the Council of Nicaea, and we Arians continued to be looked down upon by the arrogant Romans. Thus, the triumph of the true doctrine of Arianism over the heretics that condemned us at Nicaea can only be achieved by spreading the doctrine far and wide beyond the lands of Germania."

 van_muster_vandal_levy_mission_desc: "We will need to deploy every Vandal man if we wish to carve a place for ourselves in a world dominated by empires. Before we aim to migrate or expand beyond our homeland, we must muster the full might of the Vandals to protect our tribe from those who wish us harm."

 van_sortes_vandalorum_mission_desc: "The sortes Vandalorum, or 'Vandal shares,' are lands divided up amongst the ruling Vandals in foreign lands that were once Roman. These lands are granted as estates to Vandal families, and the holders of these sortes Vandalorum have several legal and economic privileges that preserve their status as Vandals in a society of many cultures and peoples."
 van_african_trade_networks_mission_title: "African Trade Networks"
 van_african_trade_networks_mission_desc: "Our new position in the former Roman province of Africa has brought us new trade opportunities, as the breadbasket of Carthago and its surrounding territories is a center of a vast trade network across the Mediterranean. Let us therefore use our goods so we may acquire great wealth and influence."
 van_consolidate_sicily_mission_title: "Consolidate Sicily"
 van_consolidate_sicily_mission_desc: "The island of Sicily is a vital naval base for consolidating our naval dominance in the western Mediterranean Sea. To ensure that no other great power, Roman or Germanic, shall challenge us in our local waters, it is imperative that all of Sicily is under our direct control and administration. It would also be wise to establish a stronghold on the island to secure our military presence in Sicily."
 van_invasion_of_italia_mission_title: "Invasion of Italia"
 van_invasion_of_italia_mission_desc: "With the island of Sicily now a core part of the Vandal kingdom, we have the foothold necessary for launching a great invasion into the mainland province of Italia. Although the Roman Empire is crumbling from both external and internal pressures, the cities of Italia are still valuable, and whoever reigns as King in Italy shall surely possess a great degree of prestige and influence in Mediterranean affairs."
 van_patrician_of_italia_mission_title: "Patrician of Italia"
 van_patrician_of_italia_mission_desc: "While we have never been on truly good terms with the Roman Emperor in Constantinople, they are still willing to recognize any non-Latin ruler in Italia as a proper Patrician of Italia if it means the extension of Roman influence in Italy. Thus, we would be able to acquire the status of patrician of Italia, a title that gives us much prestige and influence while making us only nominally, and not de facto, subject to the Roman Emperor in the east."
 van_empire_of_vandalia_mission_title: "Empire of Vandalia"
 van_empire_of_vandalia_mission_desc: "The Romans looked down on us, seeing us as no more than uncivilized barbarians while condemning our faith as heresy. With our rapid expansion across the former Roman provinces of the western Mediterranean, we have proven ourselves greater than what we have been labeled. No longer known simply for pillage and destruction, the name Vandal shall instead inspire both fear and admiration in peoples across the known world."
 van_african_migration_mission_title: "African Migration"
 van_african_migration_mission_desc: "With the invasion of enemies from the east and pressure from the Romans, we Vandals continue to search for a new home. The lands of the Roman province of Africa are bountiful, with the city of Carthago being the most bountiful breadbasket in all of the Roman Empire. Thus, the lands of Africa are an ideal destination for our migrating peoples."
 van_cultivate_african_grain_mission_title: "Cultivate the Breadbasket"
 van_cultivate_african_grain_mission_desc: "The cities of Africa and the breadbasket city of Carthage itself were damaged in our conquests. Furthermore, the local peoples of Africa are distrustful of our rule. Let us prove ourselves benevolent and capable rulers through the cultivation of Carthage and the surrounding province, developing the lands beyond what even the Romans could achieve."
 van_capture_carthago_mission_title: "Capture Carthago"
 van_capture_carthago_mission_desc: "The breadbasket of Carthage is vital for the Roman Empire, supplying its armies and peoples with an abundance of grain and foodstuffs. Cutting off this primary source of grain would deal a crushing blow to the Romans and grant us unprecedented influence over sea and trade. Now that we have migrated to the province of Africa, it is only a matter of time before the city of Carthage falls to the Vandals."
 van_mauro_roman_subjects_mission_title: "Mauro-Roman Subjects"
 van_mauro_roman_subjects_mission_desc: "The peoples of Mauretania were among the Roman subjects who resisted our incursions into Africa. Having consolidated our position in Africa, it is now time to pacify these Mauro-Roman kings in the west once and for all and integrate them as proper subjects of the Vandal Kingdom."
 van_control_mauretania_mission_title: "Control Mauretania"
 van_control_mauretania_mission_desc: "The port cities of northern Mauretania are another valuable asset, serving as the checkpoint through which trade passes along the westernmost edges of the Mediterranean Sea. Let us therefore campaign into the lands of Atlas and capture the cities of Mauretania."
 van_subdue_the_mauri_mission_title: "Subdue the Mauri"
 van_subdue_the_mauri_mission_desc: "With the centers of Roman rule in Italy and Greece, the far western tribes of Mauretania were always just out of Roman control. With our capital in Africa, we have the position to fully subjugate the tribes of western Mauretania, which would grant us a very defensible position in the west and a valuable source of manpower in the form of Mauri auxiliaries."
 van_carthage_reborn_mission_title: "Carthage Reborn?"
 van_carthage_reborn_mission_desc: "The Carthaginians were Rome's most bitter rivals before their fall centuries ago, and stories of their bloody wars with the Romans are still told today. With the capture of the city of Carthage, our peoples more closely identify with the city. Some in our court have brought forth the idea of declaring ourselves as successors to the Carthaginians as a symbol of defiance against Roman rule. They argue that adopting a broader regional identity as a kingdom of 'Carthage' would allow our non-Germanic subjects in Africa to also more closely identify with the state, as opposed to a distinctly 'Vandal' kingdom."
 van_rex_vandalorum_et_alanorum_mission_title: "Rex Vandalorum"
 van_rex_vandalorum_et_alanorum_mission_desc: "The Vandal people have always been known for integrating and assimilating other cultures, such as Celtic traditions, foreign tribes, and even foreign deities, like those of the Celts. Our official title is even 'King of the Vandals and the Alans,' emphasizing our attempts to integrate non-Vandals into one Germanic society. Thus, let us prove our intentions with our actions and consolidate our position as a growing Germanic power of many cultures." 
 van_mighty_vandal_fleet_mission_title: "A Mighty Vandal Fleet"
 van_mighty_vandal_fleet_mission_desc: "If we wish to survive against the powerful armies of Rome, it would be best to prevent the Roman ships from reaching our shores so the Romans never have the opportunity to face us in the field. Thus, it would be in our best interest to build up a powerful navy unmatched by any power in the Mediterranean."
 van_vandalic_piracy_mission_title: "Vandalic Piracy"
 van_vandalic_piracy_mission_desc: "While the act of piracy is generally frowned upon, ultimately all that matters is who gets the gold. The Romans in the past had openly denounced piracy, yet secretly tolerated and even encouraged piracy along the shores of Cilicia as long as the pirates served their best interests and lined the pockets of Roman aristocrats. Thus, why should we be better than the Romans when such easy targets for pillaging lay vulnerable to us from across the sea?"
 van_great_palace_in_carthage_mission_title: "Great Palace in Carthage"
 van_great_palace_in_carthage_mission_desc: "In the turmoil following the collapse of Roman imperial authority in the west and the great migrations of our Vandal people, we have had little time for constructing a grand palace in Carthage rivalling those overseas. Now that we brought security and prosperity to Africa, it is time for us to build a great citadel in our capital that reflects the newly-acquired wealth and prestige of the Vandals."
 van_thriving_provincials_mission_title: "Thriving Provincials"
 van_thriving_provincials_mission_desc: "As we expand our kingdom, our economy shall also continue to grow and thrive. Let us continue to urge the provincial representatives to bleed the land dry of riches and resources for the greater benefit of the Vandal kingdom and its people."
 van_bishop_of_carthage_mission_title: "Bishop of Carthage"
 van_bishop_of_carthage_mission_desc: "Before we seized the city of Carthage, it was the seat of a Christian bishop. Although the bishop did not align with our own religious views, perhaps we could pursue a diplomatic solution and improve our relations with the rest of Christendom through permitting a non-Arian bishop to exist in Vandal Carthage."
 van_unite_the_tribes_mission_title: "Unite the Tribes"
 van_unite_the_tribes_mission_desc: "Although we are a kingdom, we are made up of a collective of tribes who all associate with the broader identity of 'Vandal.' To ensure smooth cooperation between the leaders of these tribes, let us win the loyalty of the most prominent tribal leaders and nobles in the Vandal kingdom."
 van_extract_payment_mission_title: "Extract Payment"
 van_extract_payment_mission_desc: "We Vandals have acquired a reputation of being particularly fond of acquiring gold and coin. Thus, besides the conquest of land, it brings us great joy to bleed dry the spoils of war from our enemies - perhaps an even better scenario would be obtaining consistent and regular tribute from those defeated by us."
 van_golden_hoard_mission_title: "Golden Hoard"
 van_golden_hoard_mission_desc: "We Vandals love the feeling of acquiring new riches, and we strongly dislike it whenever gold leaves our fingertips, even if it is for investments towards the betterment of our kingdom. Thus, let us build up a great hoard of gold so that we shall always have funds to fall back on in times of trouble and uncertainty."
 van_build_arian_churches_mission_title: "Build Arian Churches"
 van_build_arian_churches_mission_desc: "It had been a struggle for Arianism to gain a firm foothold in lands ruled by the those like the Romans who strongly opposed the Arian doctrine. With the establishment of an Arian kingdom under the pious rule of us Vandals, we can now sponsor the construction of proper Arian churches in our lands."
 van_convert_the_heretics_mission_title: "Convert the Heretics"
 van_convert_the_heretics_mission_desc: "The heretical Christians who deny the true doctrine of Arianism are simply misguided by the false declarations of the Council of Nicaea. Let us guide these misguided heretics onto the true path to salvation by spreading the doctrine of Arian across our ever-growing Christian realm."
 van_first_arian_patriarch_mission_title: "First Arian Patriarch"
 van_first_arian_patriarch_mission_desc: "Rejected by the Roman Empire, Arianism was never given the room to develop its own proper ecclesiastical hierarchy independent of temporal rulers. With the doctrine of Arianism solidified in our kingdom, we can now encourage the establishment of a proper Arian clergy with the legitimacy and authority to directly challenge the Nicene heretics."

While Sunomata Castle was constructed in great haste thanks to its importance in the Siege of Inabayama Castle, a proper Toyotomi capital must require more time and resources. The site of the former Ikko-Ikki temple of Ishiyama Hongan-ji is very defensible, as proven by its defense against Oda Nobunaga. Let us construct a new grant castle upon its lands that shall serve as the seat of the Toyotomi clan."

 tyt_great_fleet_mission_title: "Great Fleet"
 tyt_great_fleet_mission_desc: "During the Sengoku Jidai, the majority of naval warfare was fought between individual islands of Japan, and thus our ships are smaller and less powerful compared to the larger fleets of Korea and China. Thus, once the lands of Japan are unified under our clan we must focus on building a greater navy with more powerful ships so we may realize our ambitions of invading Korea and China."

 tyt_sail_to_ryukyu_mission_desc: "The Ryukyu islands are of interest to us now that we wish to expand our influence beyond the mainland. The Ryukyu king has refused to answer our calls for submission, hiding behind the fact that they are tributaries of the emperor of China. Let us therefore show them that they should have surrendered their arms willingly when they had the chance, as not even the Chinese emperor can protect them."

 tyt_tanegashima_production_mission_desc: "Ever since the Portuguese shipwrecked on the shores of the island of Tanegashima, introducing the technology of European arquebus to Japan, we have called these firearms Tanegashima, as the local clans of the island were quick to monopolize the replication of these firearms in the age of warfare of the Sengoku Jidai. With the expansion of the Toyotomi realm, we too may have the ability to create our own firearms, severing the need for any middlemen or over-reliance on the European firearms trade."

We cannot be certain that they shall remain loyal to our cause for long - it is therefore imperative that we humble the Tokugawa and flush out any anti-Toyotomi elements from within the clan, by force if necessary."

 row_humble_the_huns_mission_title: "Humble the Huns"
 row_humble_the_huns_mission_desc: "The mysterious yet alarming threat of the Huns looms heavy across the Roman frontiers in the east, their presence having driven the Germanic tribes towards our own borders, fleeing in terror from the Scourge of God itself. Should we be unable to humble foreign barbarians, our right to rule Rome itself would be called into question. Thus, let us muster our strength against to defeat the Huns, compelling them to kneel and beg for mercy, and take back the wealth that the Huns had stolen from us."
 row_rejuvenate_the_legions_mission_title: "Rejuvenate the Legions"
 row_rejuvenate_the_legions_mission_desc: "The various crises faced by our Empire have weakened our military forces by a significant degree, at least compared to the imperial army's peak. It has reached the point in which most of our troops are now unarmored, protected only by their shields. More costly armor and mail are now restricted to only the cavalry, and we have become increasingly reliant on foreign entities like the foederati to fight for us. Thus, let us work hard to rejuvenate our martial might, starting with the individual regional armies of our empire."
 row_military_reforms_mission_title: "Military Reforms"
 row_military_reforms_mission_desc: "There was a time when the heavy infantry of Rome was the most feared fighting force in the known world. However, as our Empire found more formidable foes in the Huns, the Parthians and the Persians, it has become clear that our military must change with the times. Thus, let us expand our cavalry so our empire may survive and thrive in an age of uncertainty and chaos."

In practice, however, this is not always the case, as the corrupt and flatterers always seem to worm their way into some of the closest of circles. Thus, let us seek out only the finest imperial generals and administrators, known as comites, or 'companions,' of the Emperor, who shall serve him with utmost loyalty."

 row_bishops_of_the_empire_mission_desc: "Although the Bishop of Rome is seen as the foremost religious leader in the western empire, we must also recognize the excellence of the various bishops of the frontier provinces, who have worked tirelessly to spread the true word of God to the farthest reaches of the Empire. Even so, there are many followers of Christ who remain misguided. One such group is the Donatists in the province of Africa, a heretical sect that continues to resist the true orthodox doctrine of Rome. Let us therefore support our bishops' efforts across the empire so we may enlighten those who have strayed from the true path."

However, should we establish a permanent presence in Britannia with loyal subjects and secure frontiers, perhaps we can prove to all, including those in Rome as well as our enemies in Britannia, that we are indeed here to stay in Britannia."

The Germanic tribes have been especially unruly. One day, they may swear their loyalty to the Emperor - the next day, they may just turn against us, ravaging our lands and slaughtering our people. Thus, let us ensure the foederati remain tied to the Roman yoke by any means necessary."

 row_comites_et_equites_mission_desc: "Once known as the respected, mounted nobility of the Roman armies, the equites have since become associated with meaningless and empty titles due to the overly-generous distribution of noble titles. Thus, Constantine established the office of the comites to distinguish the highest ranking of talents. To ensure the loyalty of nobles across the empire, let us work towards establishing goodwill with the noble generals and civil officials alike."
 row_the_empires_breadbasket_mission_title: "The Empire's Breadbasket"
 row_the_empires_breadbasket_mission_desc: "Though utterly destroyed by Rome in the Third Punic War, the city of Carthage was rebuilt a century later by Julius Caesar. The capital of the former bitter rivals of Rome as well as the province of Africa as a whole grew into a thriving breadbasket, and it now provides grain to Romans at all corners of the realm. Thus, let us continue to cultivate the breadbasket of the empire and ensure that it is well protected from any barbarian incursions."
 row_mauretania_caesariensis_mission_title: "Mauretania Caesariensis"
 row_mauretania_caesariensis_mission_desc: "The lands of Numidia were once staunch allies of Rome. The first united Numidian Kingdom was led by a certain Masinissa, an ally of Rome in the Second Punic War and a great king who cultivated the lands of Numidia, once believed to be uncultivable, into thriving farms and estates. When the Numidian kingdom was annexed by the Roman Empire, so too were its native inhabitants. Many of these peoples living in urban centers of Mauretania have been integrated into Roman culture and society. Thus, as our realm faces uncertainty and pressure form outside and within, let us make sure that we can call upon our subjects in Mauretania with confidence in times of trouble."
 row_roman_villas_of_gallia_mission_title: "Roman Villas of Gallia"
 row_roman_villas_of_gallia_mission_desc: "Much of the success of our estates in Gallia can be attributed to the Gauls themselves - Roman investors use local Gallic landowners to manage and cultivate the land, constructing thriving Gallic villas influenced by Roman culture. These villas have become major urban, economic and commercial centers of the Gallic countryside in northern Gallia. Thus, let us continue to develop these lands so we may extract the finest riches and goods from Gallia as well as ensure the continued prosperity of the villas themselves."

 row_frontiers_of_britannia_mission_desc: "As we face turmoil from within and beyond our borders, the most difficult province to defend has always been Britannia. Thus, we must consolidate our position in Britannia by extending our frontier to create a buffer region between the northern tribes of Britannia and our urban center in Londinium."
 row_riches_of_egypt_mission_title: "Riches of Egypt"
 row_riches_of_egypt_mission_desc: "The rich lands of Egypt have always been under threat from our ambitious rivals in Persia. If our imperial counterparts in Constantinople should ever prove themselves incapable of defending this valuable breadbasket of Egypt, then we will have to take matters into our own hands and place Egypt under our protection."
 row_ius_gentium_mission_title: "Ius Gentium"
 row_ius_gentium_mission_desc: "Ius gentium, or the 'law of the world,' is a form of natural law, meaning that it is a law that all of mankind observes and follows. While we Romans have our own laws, there are also many natural laws that all peoples in the world naturally follow. Thus, let us use the commonalities between Romans and barbarians alike to establish peace, cooperation and order within our realm. With our Emperor appealing to the ius gentium, our Empire would become the natural and sensible authority for all of our subjects to follow with unwavering loyalty."
 row_avenge_teutoburg_mission_title: "Avenge Teutoburg"
 row_avenge_teutoburg_mission_desc: "In Teutoburg Forest during the reign of Augustus, three legions - Legio XVII, XVIII and XIX - were ambushed by Germanic tribes led by Arminius; the legions were all entirely annihilated, a humiliating defeat that shall never be forgotten. Although we have since paid the Germani back with punitive campaigns, the Germanic lands were mostly left unconquered, deemed unnecessary additions to the Roman Empire. Even so, the Germanic threat has grown since then, and thus the need to subjugate these tribes has become a primary issue."
 row_magna_germania_mission_title: "Magna Germania"
 row_magna_germania_mission_desc: "We have made unprecedented headway into Germania, integrating new lands and peoples further northwest. There are many enthusiastic advisors and officials who desire for the official and total integration of Magna Germania as an expanded province in the north. While this may be a great undertaking, being the greatest expansion in the western territories since Julius Caesar's campaigns in Gaul, it shall be well worth it once Magna Germania has become a core part of the Roman Empire."

 row_restoration_of_italia_mission_desc: "The zenith of the city of Rome has long passed, the Eternal City now only a shadow of its former self. Though the city of Rome continues to decline in importance as we move administrative centers to new capitals such as Ravenna, we should be able to turn this trend around and restore Rome as well as all of Italia to its former glory once we return peace and prosperity to the peninsula."
 row_latifundia_of_hispania_mission_title: "Latifundia of Hispania"
 row_latifundia_of_hispania_mission_desc: "The latifundia, great privately-owned estates specializing in agriculture, are a key part of the landscape and economy of Hispania. Since the countless civil wars and Germanic migrations, many of the latifundia have fallen into decline, devastated by plunder and war. In such troubled times, it is especially important that we cultivate thriving estates and farms across the region to feed the people of Hispania as well as stimulate the regional economy back to previous levels of prosperity."
 row_unite_the_twin_capitals_mission_title: "Unite the Twin Capitals"
 row_unite_the_twin_capitals_mission_desc: "The Roman Empire was split in two in order to more efficiently administer a vast empire such as ours, with two emperors ruling from two thrones in the east and the west. Although equals in practice, should the eastern emperor in Constantinople ever prove themselves incapable of rule, perhaps it would be best to reunite the twin capitals, Roma and Nova Roma, under a single Emperor once more."

 row_alea_iacta_est_mission_title: "Alea Iacta Est"
 row_alea_iacta_est_mission_desc: "Alea iacta est, 'the die has been cast' - these were the words of Julius Caesar upon crossing the Rubicon River, marking his open defiance and civil war against his rival Pompeius Magnus. While cooperation between the eastern and western Roman emperors is ideal, there may be a time in which the two emperors come into conflict. Thus, once war has begun between the two emperors, it could be said that the die has been cast, and that there is no turning back."
 row_rome_reunited_mission_title: "The Empire Reunited"
 row_rome_reunited_mission_desc: "The die had already been cast the moment we stepped foot into Constantinople, a blatant declaration of civil war against those who claim the Eastern throne. Thus, let us do as Julius Caesar had and cross the Rhine, finish what we have started and reunite the lands of the Eastern Roman Empire's primary powerbase under our rule."
 row_renovate_roman_roads_mission_title: "Renovate Roman Roads"
 row_renovate_roman_roads_mission_desc: "The civil wars of Rome have taken a toll on infrastructure, especially in the western half of the Roman Empire. Many of the Roman roads have been left without maintenance for some time. Thus, let us dedicate ourselves to restoring our infrastructure, starting with our Roman roads, the blood vessels of the Roman Empire itself."
 row_bread_and_circuses_mission_title: "Bread and Circuses"
 row_bread_and_circuses_mission_desc: "In the past, 'bread and circuses' was a phrase used to criticize the common practice of the Roman Empire in sponsoring great games and circuses in order to distract the common people from the instability, corruption and other issues faced by the Romans. However, who is to say that it is not possible to have circuses while also having a stable and prosperous realm?"
 row_revitalize_the_economy_mission_title: "Revitalize the Economy"
 row_revitalize_the_economy_mission_desc: "The unrest faced by our state had caused a sharp decline in the economy of the Western Roman Empire. The value of Western Roman coinage, as well as the size and quality of the coins themselves, has seen a noticeable decline since coins from the golden eras of Rome. Thus, let us work hard to revitalize the economy, building up a great treasury and heeding the advice of only the most talented and well-versed in economics."
 row_question_of_arianism_mission_title: "Question of Arianism"
 row_question_of_arianism_mission_desc: "The doctrines of the heretic Arian were condemned by the Council of Nicaea. Even so, the heretical doctrine of Arianism has since seen widespread popularity, creating a great rift between fellow Christians across the empire. Thus, let us gather the most wise, pious and learned theologians across the empire and beyond to once more decide upon the question of Arianism and its place in our realm."
 row_romanization_of_the_east_mission_title: "Romanization of the East"
 row_romanization_of_the_east_mission_desc: "The lands of Dalmatia and Greece have been relatively slow to Romanize, especially with the Greeks maintaining their distinct cultural identity in their homeland. The Eastern Roman Empire has been greatly influenced by the Greeks, and critics of Romanization have claimed that Greek culture has defeated our own Roman culture in the east. Thus, let us put greater effort into assimilating the eastern peoples into the proper Roman identity."
 row_march_to_syria_mission_title: "March to Syria"
 row_march_to_syria_mission_desc: "The lands of Syria have long been a contested battleground between rival powers, whether it be between the Roman and Persian Empires or between the Hellenistic empires of old. As we make further gains in our war for reuniting the Roman Empire under one emperor, the lands of Syria shall become a vital battleground once more."
 row_trajans_conquests_mission_title: "Trajan's Conquests"
 row_trajans_conquests_mission_desc: "The great Roman emperor Trajan expanded the Roman Empire to its greatest extent in history, driving back the mighty Parthian Empire and seizing all of Mesopotamia for Rome. Although Mesopotamia was quickly lost after its acquisition, many emperors still dreamed of one day emulating the achievements of the great Trajan."
 row_diplomats_in_constantinople_mission_title: "Diplomats in Constantinople"
 row_diplomats_in_constantinople_mission_desc: "Though the Roman Empire was split between an emperor in the west and an emperor in the east, we remain united through the spirit of the eternal city of Rome. Thus, let us maintain close ties with the eastern emperor in Constantinople."
 row_fund_the_war_machine_mission_title: "Fund the War Machine"
 row_fund_the_war_machine_mission_desc: "Our armies have always been funded by the spoils of war. With our armies and borders now stretched across great spans of land and sea, it is no surprise that we find ourselves unable to expand much further beyond our established borders, leaving our treasury quite strained under the burden of imperial governance. Thus, rather than through direct conquest, let us continue to fund the Roman war machine through extracting tribute from the defeated."
 row_chi_rho_mission_title: "Chi Rho"
 row_chi_rho_mission_desc: "In his struggle to reunite the Roman Empire, the great Emperor Constantine looked up and witnessed a divine vision, a great cross of light over the sun. Constantine and his soldiers all witnessed this vision, and by nightfall Constantine was visited by Christ Himself in a dream, who told Constantine to create a replica of the image in the sky, which Constantine carried with him to victory. Thus, the Chi Rho was born as a symbol of the glory of Christ, which guides us not only in times of peace as well as times of war."
 row_convert_the_pagans_mission_title: "Convert the Pagans"
 row_convert_the_pagans_mission_desc: "Many pagans along the frontiers of the provinces continue to cling onto the old gods. Let us spread the true word of God to these misguided pagans and unite all of the Roman Empire under the holy cross."
 row_christian_authority_mission_title: "Christian Authority"
 row_christian_authority_mission_desc: "The Bishop of Rome is the Vicar, or representative, of Peter himself, and is thus among the most prominent of patriarchs in Christendom. Thus, let us establish the Emperor of Rome as the defender of Christendom itself, backed by the Bishop of Rome. And if the eastern Emperor in Constantinople should object to such a bold declaration, then so be it."
 row_roman_navy_reborn_mission_title: "Roman Navy Reborn"
 row_roman_navy_reborn_mission_desc: "When the Roman Empire became the sole naval power of the Mediterranean, so much so the sea has been coined 'Mare Nostrum,' or 'Our Sea,' the navy no longer needed to maintain a peak fighting force. Mostly used for transporting troops and combating pirates, the naval capabilities of the Empire have seen a steep decline, hastened by the many internal crises faced by the Roman Empire. Thus, let us work hard to reestablish a navy of combat-ready warships, and thus regain the maritime traditions of old - the same traditions that had crushed the likes of Carthage and the successors of Alexander the Great."
 row_roman_navy_reborn_mission.tt: "Have at least §Y5§! ships that are either Galleys or Heavy Ships"
 row_legacy_of_actium_mission_title: "Legacy of Actium"
 row_legacy_of_actium_mission_desc: "The Battle of Actium was the largest naval battle in Roman history - it concluded with the defeat of Marcus Antonius and the decisive solidification of Emperor Augustus' rule as the first de facto ruler of the Roman Empire. Though it was a glorious battle that saw the birth of the Empire, it was the last major naval engagement in Roman history. With Mare Nostrum under full Roman control, the Roman navy, used only for combating piracy, began to decay as no naval power could stand up to the Empire's might. Thus, with our restored Roman navy, let us achieve glory on the seas once more."

When the kingdom of Asturias was split between the crowns of Galicia and León, a sense of uniting between those living in these two lands was lost. Although the kings of the two lands have coordinated well to combat the Moors, we lack the uniting required to decisively drive out the heathens once and for all. Thus, let us unite the de jure and de facto crowns of León and Galicia under a single ruler."

 lon_camino_de_santiago_mission_desc: "Santiago, also known as Saint James, was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus and is especially renowned in the lands of Galicia. It is believed by many that his remains were found in Compostela, proof that the great Santiago was buried in our own very lands. This has led to increased pilgrimage to Compostela, so much so that the route of pilgrimage has earned a name: Camino de Santiago. Additionally, it is believed that the great Santiago miraculously appeared at the Battle of Clavijo to lead the Christian warriors of Asturias to victory against the Moors, leading to the creation of a prominent cult of worship as well as the nickname Santiago Matamoros, or Saint James the 'Moor-Slayer.' If we support the pious followers of Santiago by developing the holy site of Compostela as well as foster a safe haven in Galicia to ensure the security of pilgrims, we would greatly benefit from the political, religious, economic and diplomatic benefits of such developments."

 prt_perfect_the_parthian_shot_mission_title: "Perfect the Parthian Shot"
 prt_perfect_the_parthian_shot_mission_desc: "We Parthians are famed for the Parthian Shot, a maneuver in which mounted archers feign retreat before utilizing their skill on horseback to turn around and rain arrows upon the unsuspecting enemy in reckless pursuit. It was this battlefield tactic that destroyed the armies of Crassus of Rome, and the Parthian shot shall continue to wreak devastation upon Roman armies for generations to come."
 prt_humble_the_romans_mission_title: "Humble the Romans"
 prt_humble_the_romans_mission_desc: "The Romans believe themselves to be so much more sophisticated, enlightened and powerful than their neighbors, referring to all non-Romans and non-Greeks as barbarians, just as the Greeks had called us Parthians just a few generations ago. Thus, just as we crushed the pompous Greek Seleukids, let us now humble the arrogant Romans and march our armies into the heart of Rome itself."
 prt_successors_of_the_diadochi_mission_title: "Successors of the Diadochi"
 prt_successors_of_the_diadochi_mission_desc: "Although we are a distinctly Parthian empire, the first of our kind, we carry with us the legacy of the diadochi, the successors to Alexander the Great. As we supplanted the Hellenistic powers, most notably the Seleukid Empire, we adopted various Hellenistic traditions and forms of governance, just as Alexander had adopted Persian customs and kingship upon his conquest of the Persian Empire."
 prt_acquire_palaestina_mission_title: "Acquire Palaestina"
 prt_acquire_palaestina_mission_desc: "If we wish to realize our ambitions in Egypt, we must secure a strategic foothold in the lands of Palaestina, a region that has long been a staging ground for conflict between larger imperial powers. Securing these lands would also secure us access to the Mediterranean, meaning we no longer need to rely on middlemen for our trade with the faraway cities of the Mediterranean."
 prt_sahan_sah_in_egypt_mission_title: "Shahanshah in Egypt"
 prt_sahan_sah_in_egypt_mission_desc: "The last time a Shahanshah ruled in Egypt was the Achaemenid empire of Persia prior to the conquests of Alexander the Great. The lands of Egypt are a rich breadbasket, as valuable for its wealth as it is for its grain and natural resources provided by the Nile River. Acquiring the lands of Egypt for our empire would mark a significant turning point in our long conflict against our Roman rivals."
 prt_develop_alexandreia_mission_title: "Develop Alexandreia"
 prt_develop_alexandreia_mission_desc: "The city of Alexandreia has been a center for trade, culture and learning for centuries since its foundation, though now it stands neglected and in decay under the incompetent Romans. Let us therefore restore the prestige and prosperity of Alexandreia as successors to the Hellenistic legacy in Egypt."
 prt_consolidate_persia_mission_title: "Consolidate Persia"
 prt_consolidate_persia_mission_desc: "While we rule of the lands of Persia as a smaller ruling class of Parthians, we have adopted many Persian traditions, customs and ways of governance to ensure stability and prosperity in our Persian territories. As we rely on the Persian cities for wealth, resources and manpower, we must consolidate our position as undisputed hegemons of Persia."
 prt_restore_royal_roads_mission_title: "Restore Royal Roads"
 prt_restore_royal_roads_mission_desc: "A great network of royal roads thrived under the Achaemenid Persian Empire. The Greek historian Herodotus noted that it is thanks to these roads that the speed of the Persian messengers was unmatched in all of the world. If we restore the royal roads in our own empire, we would not only acquire an efficient transport and postal network but also take further steps in ensuring our status as legitimate rulers of Persia."
 prt_erythraean_sea_trade_mission_title: "Erythraean Sea Trade"
 prt_erythraean_sea_trade_mission_desc: "The Erythraean Sea is a vital crossroads of trade and goods, serving as the point at which goods pass from the Mediterranean, Egypt, Arabia, Punt, Persia and India. By establishing ourselves as the dominant trade power in the network, the Parthian Empire and its subjects would continue to reap its benefits for generations to come."
 prt_learn_from_characene_mission_title: "Learn from the Characeneans"
 prt_learn_from_characene_mission_desc: "Before we gained the submission of Characene, we Parthians did not have any knowledge of seafaring, and we lacked a proper navy to enforce our interests beyond our shores. When the Characeneans became our subjects, we inherited their navy, and Parthian rulers allowed the Characeneans to manage all matters naval on our behalf. Rather than leaving everything up to the Characeneans, perhaps we should learn from them and establish a formidable naval force of our own."
 prt_control_the_twin_rivers_mission_title: "Control the Twin Rivers"
 prt_control_the_twin_rivers_mission_desc: "It is said that the twin rivers of the Euphrates and Tigris are together the birthplace of civilization itself. Centuries ago, our forefathers seize the cities of Babylon, Seleukeia and Ctesiphon from the Hellenistic Seleukid empire, securing the lower regions of Mesopotamia for our own empire. Now, let us march further north to secure all of Mesopotamia as Parthian territories and clients."
 prt_march_to_cappadocia_mission_title: "March to Cappadocia"
 prt_march_to_cappadocia_mission_desc: "After the death of Alexander the Great, the lands of Cappadocia were a major site of resistance against Hellenic rule, the kingdom of Cappadocia being led by a Persian dynasty that survived the fall of the Achaemenid Persian Empire. With the lands of Cappadocia now under the rule of the Romans, let us continue the legacy of defiance against the Hellenics by seizing Cappadocia for ourselves and establishing a firm foothold in Anatolia."
 prt_lord_of_asia_mission_title: "Lord of Asia"
 prt_lord_of_asia_mission_desc: "When Alexander the Great acquired the lands of Egypt and conquered Anatolia from the Achaemenid Persian Empire, he visited the oracle of Egypt, who confirmed the divinity of Alexander. From then on, Alexander declared himself the 'Lord of all Asia' and a divine king. Now that we have secured the lands of Persia, let us continue our march to conquer the lands of Asia Minor so we can emulate the great Alexander and inherit the Hellenistic legacy as the new Lord of Asia!"
 prt_heirs_of_the_achaemenids_mission_title: "Heirs of the Achaemenids"
 prt_heirs_of_the_achaemenids_mission_desc: "Previous rulers of our Parthian Empire, such as our ancestor Mithridates I the Great, had claimed descendance from the prestigious Achaemenid dynasty, the very same ruling dynasty of the great Achaemenid Persian Empire that reigned over a vast realm from Anatolia to Egypt to Arachosia for hundreds of years. While the empire has long been dead, their legacy continues to live on in the annals of history as well as in our owns veins."
 prt_heirs_of_the_achaemenids_mission.tt: "Have the option to form §TPersia§!, reforming the Persian Empire"
 prt_develop_ctesiphon_mission_title: "Develop Ctesiphon"
 prt_develop_ctesiphon_mission_desc: "The city of Ctesiphon was first a military garrison set up by our forefathers - today, Ctesiphon has grown into one of the largest and most populous cities in the entire world, rivaling the city of Rome to the west in size and splendor. Thus, let us continue to develop this capital city so it is unmatched by all others."
 prt_build_up_seleukeia_mission_title: "Renovate Greek Cities"
 prt_build_up_seleukeia_mission_desc: "Although we have conquered the lands of Mesopotamia from the Hellenistic power of the Seleukid Empire, their cities still remain under our rule, many of them dating back to the reign of Alexander the Great himself. With the ascension of our capital of Ctesiphon along the Tigris River, many of these Greek cities, while still flourishing, have since fallen out of prominence, and some prominent Greek cities such as Seleukeia on the Tigris have suffered damage from our wars with the Romans. Thus, let us develop and renovate these Greek cities into proper Parthian-styled cities."
 prt_gods_of_babylonia_mission_title: "Gods of Babylonia"
 prt_gods_of_babylonia_mission_desc: "When Cyrus the Great of the Persian Achaemenid Empire entered Babylonia, he declared that the deities of Babylon themselves had anointed Cyrus to liberate the people from the Babylonian Empire. Similarly, when our ancestor and Parthian king Mithridates I entered Mesopotamia, he personally entered the holy cities of Assyria and Babylonia and devoted himself to the Great Gods of Akkad. Thus, while we are dedicated primarily to Ahuramazda, we can win over the Babylonians by continuing this tradition of religious tolerance."
 prt_call_upon_the_azat_mission_title: "Call Upon the Azat"
 prt_call_upon_the_azat_mission_desc: "Rather than a standing army, the Parthian empire relies on levies raised from the various nobles, or azat, from across the Parthian realm. The nobles make up the cavalry backbone of our military, so it would be wise for us to prepare the best we can before our campaigns to ensure swift and efficient mobilization of levies to the battlefront."
 prt_rein_in_house_suren_mission_title: "Rein in House Suren"
 prt_rein_in_house_suren_mission_desc: "The Suren house is one of the Seven Great Houses of Parthia, the seven most prominent noble families in our empire. While they have enjoyed much autonomy, many privileges and exceptional degrees of favor from the Parthian royal family, the Suren house have also ventured beyond the lands of Parthia, establishing their own kingdoms in the east such as the Indo-Parthian kingdom. These Suren kingdoms are fully autonomous from the Parthian crown and could perhaps even one day challenge our hegemony in their respective regions; thus, it may be prudent for us to ensure they are subject to us while we can."
 prt_control_the_indus_mission_title: "Control the Indus"
 prt_control_the_indus_mission_desc: "The Indus River is a major natural barrier between the lands of Persia and those of India. Besides this fact, the naval opportunities that would result from controlling the Indus are also an incentive for leading a campaign to seize the river. We Parthians are quite limited navally, so the conquest of the great Indus River would grant us access to more ports for expanding our naval capabilities."
 prt_spices_of_india_mission_title: "Spices of India"
 prt_spices_of_india_mission_desc: "One of the most lucrative trades in the world is the spice trade, with most of the world's spices sourced from the eastern lands of India. Now that we have a foothold in India with the conquest of the Indus River, the namesake of India itself, let us acquire the loyalties of the eastern merchants and establish the Parthians as the new leaders of the spice trade."
 prt_client_king_in_pontus_mission_title: "Client King in Pontus"
 prt_client_king_in_pontus_mission_desc: "The kingdom of Pontus today is only a shell of its former self - the great kingdom of Mithridates VI the Great that once valiantly resisted against the Romans has been reduced to a Roman client state led by puppets to Roman interests. Let us liberate the peoples of Pontus and continue what Mithridates VI had started - first, we shall liberate Pontus; then, we shall liberate all of Anatolia, just as Mithridates had envisioned."
 prt_client_king_in_pontus_mission.tt: "Have the option to cede land in Anatolia to a §YClient Kingdom§! of §TPontus§!"
 prt_dominate_hellas_mission_title: "Dominate Hellas"
 prt_dominate_hellas_mission_desc: "The homeland of the Greeks fell to the Romans long ago, and today the Greeks are seen as among the core territories of the Roman Empire. Thus, seizing the lands of Greece from the Romans would serve as a crushing blow to the Roman Empire. Besides the strategic victory, we would also achieve a symbolic victory as successors of the Persian Empire and Hellenistic Empires by being the first of the Iranian powers to fully subjugate Greece once and for all."
 prt_hellenic_infantrymen_mission_title: "Hellenic Infantrymen"
 prt_hellenic_infantrymen_mission_desc: "While our great success against the Romans can be attributed to our formidable cavalry as well as our famed Parthian shot and other cavalry tactics, we would also benefit from a strong auxiliary force of infantry, especially as we advance further west into terrains that favor infantry. The Greeks have had a centuries-long legacy of powerful infantry, a heritage that even influenced how the Romans waged war."
 prt_parthian_heartland_mission_title: "Parthian Heartland"
 prt_parthian_heartland_mission_desc: "Before the Parthian kingdom, we Parthians were part of the Dahae Confederation. Although no longer unified, our cousin tribes of the former Dahae still reside in Parthian lands as well as lands to the north of Hyrcania. Thus, let us concentrate on consolidating the defenses of our Parthian homeland so we can secure our borders, acquire the various Dahae tribes' submission and reorganize the tribes into a proper client state of Parthia."
 prt_parthian_heartland_mission.tt: "Spawns §TDahae§! as a Tribal §YClient Kingdom§! in the Parthian homeland"
 prt_win_over_the_tribes_mission_title: "Win Over the Tribes"
 prt_win_over_the_tribes_mission_desc: "Besides the noble houses, our empire also relies on various nomadic tribes in campaigns. As many of these tribesmen learn how to ride on horseback before even learning how to walk, their cavalry are valuable auxiliaries in distant campaigns. Additionally, appeased tribes are much less likely to revolt and raid our frontier cities and settlements, and foreign tribes impressed or intimidated by our might shall be more likely to submit to Parthian hegemony."
 prt_influence_armenia_mission_title: "Influence Armenia"
 prt_influence_armenia_mission_desc: "The Kingdom of Armenia has long been contested between the Parthian and Roman Empires. We had even placed a branch of our ruling Arsacid dynasty on the Armenian throne to ensure their loyalty to our empire. Acting as a buffer zone between the two great powers, the rulers of Armenia should be made friends of the Parthian throne to ensure our interests are realized in the region."
 prt_greater_armenia_mission_title: "Greater Armenia"
 prt_greater_armenia_mission_desc: "Tigranes the Great of Armenia had established a great empire of his own, ruling over lands in Armenia, Cappadocia and Syria. Though Tigranes was defeated by the Persians, let us avenge Tigranes by vanquishing the Romans to take back the lands once under the control of the Armenian Kingdom."
 prt_kushan_diplomacy_mission_title: "Kushan Diplomacy"
 prt_kushan_diplomacy_mission_desc: "Around the same time that the Arsacid dynasty of Parthia defeated the Seleukid Empire and conquered the lands of Media, Persia and Mesopotamia, further east the Hellenistic kingdom of Bactria was defeated by the tribes of the Yuezhi. Just as we have formed our own empire from tribal beginnings, in the east the Yuezhi have formed the Kushan Empire. Thus, we now have the question of whether we should deal with them: with diplomacy as cordial equals, or with force as destined rivals."
 prt_kushan_diplomacy_mission.tt: "If have §Y100+ opinion§! from Kushan, gain a §TTruce§! with them; If §Yinsulted§! them, gain §T20 Prestige§!"
 prt_sway_the_client_kings_mission_title: "Sway the Client Kings"
 prt_sway_the_client_kings_mission_desc: "We Parthians mostly care only for the conquest of territory; as a formerly nomadic peoples, we have little interest in directly ruling over the far reaches of our great empire. Thus, besides appointing nobles and members of the royal family to govern the domains of the empire, we have also entrusted various client kings such as those of Persis, Characene and Elymais to rule their respective territories in our stead. Thus, to ensure their loyalty to Parthia as well as keep the peace between Parthians and subjects, we should focus on winning over these client kings through diplomacy, gold and gifts."
 prt_annex_persis_mission_title: "Annex Persis"
 prt_annex_persis_mission_desc: "As we continue to become more and more Persianized, we view the heartlands of Persia with increasingly greater interest. When our forefathers first conquered the Frataraka of Persis from the control of the Hellenistic Seleukid Empire, a local king of Persia was appointed to rule Persis on our behalf. However, now that we have established ourselves as the proper heirs of the Achaemenid and Hellenistic legacies, perhaps we should take steps towards integrating the Persian heartland into Parthia proper."
 prt_adur_burzen_mihr_mission_title: "Adur Burzen-Mihr"
 prt_adur_burzen_mihr_mission_desc: "There are many holy fires across our empire, some of them dating back centuries beyond the time of the Achaemenid Empire itself. However, the most important flame of Parthia is located in Adur Burzen-Mihr. As the primary Zoroastrian fire of the Parthian royal family and people, it is imperative that we continue to kindle this flame and develop the surrounding city to ensure the prosperity and security of the holy fire's home."
 prt_appeal_to_the_magi_mission_title: "Appeal to the Magi"
 prt_appeal_to_the_magi_mission_desc: "The conquest of Persia and Media from the Seleukid Empire marked the return of Zoroastrian rule to these regions and peoples. Thus, let us continue to establish ourselves as the premier and undisputed leader of Zoroastrians in the world by heeding the sagely advice of the priestly class and spreading the faith across our empire, thus proving our piety to Ahuramazda."
 prt_silk_road_mission_title: "Silk Road"
 prt_silk_road_mission_desc: "The merchants and rulers of Sogdia have grown wealthy from the silk trade between China and the west. Serving as middlemen, the Sogdians are able to charge much higher prices for valuable goods such as silk, making great profits and therefore benefiting even more from the Silk Road than the Chinese merchants themselves. Should we subjugate Sogdia, we would be the new middlemen who shall reap the riches of the silk trade."
 prt_caucasian_tribute_mission_title: "Caucasian Tribute"
 prt_caucasian_tribute_mission_desc: "The Caucasian powers of Iberia have been a grounds for contention between the greater powers of Parthia and Rome for generations. Furthermore, the Alans and other nomadic tribes north of the Caucasus continue to use these defensible lands to raid our cities close by the range. Thus, let us win the favor of the kingdoms and tribes of the region to ensure the security of our northwestern holdings."
 prt_the_jade_gate_mission_title: "City of Hospitality"
 prt_the_jade_gate_mission_desc: "The oasis city of Kashgar is a gateway through which silk and other valuable trade goods from the far eastern lands of China pass to reach the lands of Sogdia, Persia and to western lands beyond. As a hospitable stop for traders from across the world, the city of Kashgar has become known to the Chinese as 'Shule' and in Sanskrit as 'Srikrirati,' meaning 'fortunate hospitality.' Should we secure control of Kashgar, we would exert even greater influence over the silk trade as wealthy middlemen between the Chinese and Mediterranean realms."
 prt_the_seven_great_houses_mission_title: "The Seven Great Houses"
 prt_the_seven_great_houses_mission_desc: "Besides the Parthian kings themselves, the Seven Great Houses of Parthia dominate Parthian politics and own several large estates across our empire. As our empire relies primarily on levies and cavalry from these noble families, it would be wise for us to ensure the seven houses remain loyal to us through whatever practical means necessary."
 prt_expand_the_realm_mission_title: "Expand the Realm"
 prt_expand_the_realm_mission_desc: "Though the nobles of the Seven Houses of Parthia are loyal to us now, they desire greater things just like any other common person. By expanding our empire, we would acquire new lands that we can grant to the noble families in exchange for their loyalty and guaranteed military contributions."
 prt_kindle_the_fires_mission_title: "Kindle the Fires"
 prt_kindle_the_fires_mission_desc: "We have been the only major Zoroastrian power since the great Achaemenid empire of Persia itself, as following the conquests of Alexander the Great the followers of Ahuramazda had fallen under primarily Hellenistic rule. Thus, let us prove our loyalty to Ahuramazda and continue kindling the holy fires across our empire."
 
 #SUK Sukhothai
 suk_the_first_thai_crown_mission_title: "The First Thai Crown"
 suk_the_first_thai_crown_mission_desc: "Having won independence from the crowns of the Mon and Khmer, we Thais of Sukhothai have established the first truly independent Thai kingdom. Thus, let us continue to consolidate our rule as the first Thai crown and ensure our kingdom shall last for future generations to come."
 suk_pho_khun_mission_title: "Pho Khun"
 suk_pho_khun_mission_desc: "Rather than viewing us as a divine ruler like a Devaraja, we wish for our fellow Thai subjects to look upon us as father figure who shall lend a benevolent and guiding hand to them in times of peace as well as in times of trouble. Thus, our ruler is known as Pho Khun, meaning 'father,' to emphasize this paternal relationship with our subjects. While there are certainly benefits to a divine, autocratic system of rule, earning the respect and love of our subjects shall result in loyalty that is not as easily broken by avarice or doubt."
 suk_royal_elephants_mission_title: "Royal Elephants"
 suk_royal_elephants_mission_desc: "We Thais have built up a relationship with our elephants over the course of generations; our royal family itself has many elephants of its own. The elephants help us with daily life in times of peace and accompany our armies in times of war. As elephants are thus an invaluable asset to Sukhothai and the Thai people, we must continue to raise strong war elephants who shall bring peace and security to our kingdom."
 suk_expand_the_mandala_mission_title: "Expand the Mandala"
 suk_expand_the_mandala_mission_desc: "Our capital city of Sukhothai relies on the mandala system to rule the vast territories beyond our city limits. Meaning 'circle' in Sanskrit and symbolizing the universe itself, the mandala involves various city-states answering to a single overlord. In our kingdom, the city of Sukhothai maintains its authority over various local rulers of mueang, or cities, subject to our rule. In exchange for protection, these cities provide tribute and manpower. Thus, let us continue to expand our mandala and acquire new subjects who shall serve us loyally for generations."
 suk_secure_tribute_mission_title: "Secure Tribute"
 suk_secure_tribute_mission_desc: "Our control over the various mueang who have military obligations would be difficult to maintain should we ever grow too large and unstable; the death of a king, no matter how loved or hated, would be enough to throw various mueang into open defiance and rebellion. Thus, let us establish many tributaries without military obligations to expand our influence without straining the net of control we have over our subjects."
 suk_contest_the_cham_mission_title: "Contest the Cham"
 suk_contest_the_cham_mission_desc: "The people of Champa are among the various independent polities who rule the lands of Southeast Asia. Known for their seafaring capabilities as well as their lucrative trade networks across the region, from seas of southern China to the Indian Ocean. Thus, we would benefit greatly if the Cham people were loyal subjects of ours."
 suk_viet_diplomacy_mission_title: "Viet Diplomacy"
 suk_viet_diplomacy_mission_desc: "The Viet peoples are separated from us Thais by a vast mountain range that is not easily passable. Before we commit our forces to a risky campaign across these mountains, we must first consider whether we should take a diplomatic approach with the people of Dai Viet."
 suk_imperial_ambitions_mission_title: "Imperial Ambitions"
 suk_imperial_ambitions_mission_desc: "Having toppled the once great Khmer Empire and gained entry to the lands of the Viet peoples, we suddenly have obtained new and greater ambitions, ones which our forefathers would never have even dared to dream. Thus, let us reach north and seize the Mandate of Heaven itself, just as the Mongols had done to the Song, and establish a Thai dynasty in the Middle Kingdom!"
 suk_a_thai_silk_road_mission_title: "A Thai Silk Road"
 suk_a_thai_silk_road_mission_desc: "Having claimed the throne of the Heaven in the Middle Kingdom, we now have the opportunity to establish Thai control of the Silk Road itself. Thus, let us export both Chinese and Thai silk to the west so we may bring wealth, security and prosperity to both our Thai and Chinese subjects alike."
 suk_control_the_mae_nam_mission_title: "Mae Nam"
 suk_control_the_mae_nam_mission_desc: "The Chao Phraya River is one of many rivers, known in Thai as 'mae nam,' or 'mother of waters.' However, this major river is especially vital, as it not only supplies us our harvests but also serves as the central trading hub for the region. Thus, securing the Mae Nam and its trading posts will greatly benefit our country and people by giving us greater access to open seas trade and promoting internal trade between the mueang of our kingdom."
 suk_thai_silk_mission_title: "Thai Silk"
 suk_thai_silk_mission_desc: "Unlike other regions in the world, our silk is not entirely imported from the lands of China; instead, we grow and raise our own silkworms and weave our own silk. Although we mostly produce Thai silk for personal use, we have never truly attempted marketing and exporting Thai silk abroad. Thus, let us begin the trade of silk to neighboring lands, like those of the Khmer and Malay, and perhaps even India itself."
 suk_unite_the_mueang_mission_title: "Unite the Mueang"
 suk_unite_the_mueang_mission_desc: "The mandala system functions only if the various mueang, or city-states, subject to the city of Sukhothai remain loyal and steadfast. Many of the ruling dynasties of these mueang also exert a great degree of influence in the politics of the capital of Sukhothai as well as the kingdom as a whole. Thus, let us appease the mueang and promote greater unity by addressing the advice and complaints of the various local rulers under Sukhothai."
 suk_challenge_the_empire_mission_title: "Challenge the Empire"
 suk_challenge_the_empire_mission_desc: "Our kingdom of Sukhothai was born when the mueang, or city-state, or Sukhothai broke free from the grasp of the Khmer Empire and declared and independent, Thai kingdom in Sukhothai. As we continue to grow our power and subjugate the various mueang surrounding Sukhothai, including both Thais and non-Thais alike, we would amass enough power and influence to challenge our former overlords, the Khmer Empire itself."
 suk_hegemonize_the_khmer_mission_title: "Hegemonize the Khmer"
 suk_hegemonize_the_khmer_mission_desc: "With the key city of Angkor taken by our forces, we have inflicted great damage to the morale and martial capacity of the Khmer Empire. Thus, let us continue our advance until we have thoroughly and truly subjugated the remnants of the Angkor Empire that continue to resist our undisputed hegemony."
 suk_control_the_spice_trade_mission_title: "Control the Spice Trade"
 suk_control_the_spice_trade_mission_desc: "Now that we control Malacca, we have greater access to rich, new markets far beyond the lands of Sukhothai, including the lucrative spice trade of the southern seas. We should secure additional entrepots around the Straits of Malacca to assert our dominance of the spice trade."
 suk_cultivate_sukhothai_mission_title: "Cultivate Sukhothai"
 suk_cultivate_sukhothai_mission_desc: "In the mandala system, our kingdom is more of a collection of city-states, or mueang, which all answer to a single supreme city state, ours being the capital city of Sukhothai. Thus, our legitimacy and power projection over our subjects and tributaries is only as great as our city itself. Thus, let us develop our city into a grand mueang that shall be both respected and admired by peoples across the realm, including both those subject to us as well as those far beyond our kingdom’s borders."

 suk_thai_liberation_mission_title: "Thai Liberation"
 suk_thai_liberation_mission_desc: "The birth of the Sukhothai kingdom was one of liberation - we Tai peoples migrated south from our ancestral homeland and settled in various cities and villages across the realm, including the city of Sukhothai. Though first under the rule of Khmer and Mon monarchs, our capital city of Sukhothai led a successful rebellion against our overlords and established its own fine kingdom in the lands of Suvarnabhumi."

 suk_launggyet_kingdom_mission_desc: "The Arakanese peoples centered in Launggyet had enjoyed independence from the Burmese rulers of the Pagan kingdom due to various geographic and political factors. The home to a naval tradition not shared by any of the Burmese peoples, the Arakanese engage in both trade and piracy. Thus, we would have much to learn from them if we wish to establish our own naval power and access Indian markets - such knowledge can be obtained through conquest or diplomacy."

While Arakan is an eager ally of ours, there are other powers who may contest our influence along the Arakanese coast.

 nan_southern_settlement_mission_desc: "There are various other southern polities that remain outside our sphere of influence, including the Tai polities directly north of the lands ruled by Angkor.

 nan_wisdom_of_the_azhali_mission_desc: "Azhali are tantric priests unique to the Vajrayana Buddhist religion practiced by the Bai people, a form of the religion that has become known as Azhaliism as a result of their prominent role in the religion as well as Bai society as a whole. The Azhali (known in Sanskrit as acharyas, meaning ‘teachers’) had brought Buddhism to Nanzhao and became official state mentors to all of the kings of Nanzhao."

Just as the wise emperor Ashoka had sent missionaries across the world from India, let us spread the Lord Buddha's teachings far and wide from our homeland in Nanzhao."

 nan_rule_miandian_mission_desc: "The region south of our homeland of Yunnan is a land known to the Chinese as Miandian. The land and these peoples have direct access to the sea, more specifically access to waters shared with the neighboring lands of India. As a result, the port cities of Miandian have benefited greatly from the maritime trade between India and China. Thus, to rule over Miandian is to not only subjugate its lands and peoples but to also rule over the waters besides its shores."

Before the flow of trade in the region became centered around the Strait of Malacca, this land, along with the land of the Khmer, served as the major point through which trade between India and China would pass, and while it has lost its prominence it remains a key destination for foreign traders across the world. Thus, the cities of this fertile river valley are valuable to our kingdom's growing realm and economy."

While we trust them to take care of the imperial household as well as the Emperor's harem, this closeness with members of the imperial family has allowed the eunuchs to wield great power.

 hnd_korean_tribute_mission_desc: "Although the Han dynasty defeated Gojoseon many years ago and established the Four Commanderies of Han in its former territories, the Korean kingdom of Goguryeo rose up in defiance of us and seized three of the four commanderies from Han rule.

To ensure internal stability and avoid dynastic strife, let us work to appease imperial scions and other noble families of the empire."
 hnd_bolster_the_beijun_mission_title: "Bolster the Beijun"
 hnd_bolster_the_beijun_mission_desc: "The Beijun, meaning 'Northern Army,' is the sole professional force of full-time soldiers in the Han empire. Established many generations ago, its soldiers exist to guard the northern frontiers against nomadic barbarian invaders, which make up the main threat to our empire. The cavalry make up the backbone of this force, as they are needed to counter the cavalries of the northern barbarians. Thus, let us reinforce the Beijun and safeguard the north."
 hnd_wu_hu_diplomacy_mission_title: "Wu Hu Diplomacy"
 hnd_wu_hu_diplomacy_mission_desc: "The Wu Hu are the Five Barbarians, five non-Han peoples that live along our northern borders that include the Xiongnu, Jie, Xianbei, Qiang and Di. Since we frequently face armed resistance from these peoples, it would be wise for us to establish cordial relations with the five barbarians so they will not be a concern for us in the near future."

However, the Western Han dynasty was usurped by Wang Mang, who established the Xin dynasty - Wang Mang was then toppled, and the Han dynasty continued in the new capital city of Luoyang as the Eastern Han. Let us continue to develop the current capital of Luoyang as well as the ancestral capital of Chang'an so we may prove ourselves the true Son of Heaven."

 hnd_western_protectorate_mission_desc: "In search of the Heavenly Horses of Ferghana, the Han dynasty clashed with the kingdom of Dayuan and emerged victorious, later establishing the Protectorate of the Western Regions. Although we originally had a designated Protector-General assigned to our vassals in the Western Regions, conflict with barbarians such as the Qiang people made it increasingly difficult to maintain a military presence there. Thus, let us march our forces west so we may reorganize the lands into a united protectorate that we can rule over with greater efficiency."

 hnd_jiaozhi_development_mission_desc: "Jiaozhi Commandery to the far south is among the most difficult regions for us to govern, being so far from our capital as well as the more urbanized north. Furthermore, we continue to face armed resistance from our Vietnamese subjects in Jiaozhi. Thus, it would be wise to further develop the cities, infrastructure, roads and supply routes of Jiaozhi so its lands may be more easily administered and governed far from the capital."
 hnd_integrate_nanyue_mission_title: "Integrate Nanyue"
 hnd_integrate_nanyue_mission_desc: "The Vietnamese peoples derive their name from Nam Viet, the Vietnamese pronunciation of the former kingdom of Nanyue in the south. To prevent any further large-scale rebellions of the Yue peoples, let us integrate and assimilate them into Han society so they may view us as familiar and benevolent rulers rather than hostile and foreign invaders."
 hnd_control_the_silk_road_mission_title: "Control the Silk Road"
 hnd_control_the_silk_road_mission_desc: "One of our main exports to the west is our silk, created using silkworms born and raised exclusively in our lands. For centuries, various barbarian peoples across the world have sought after our fine silk, and they shall continue to do so for as long as they do not have silkworms of their own. Thus, in order to maximize our profits, we must ensure that we have exclusive control over the parts of the Silk Road that pass through the lands within our reach."
 hnd_the_hexi_corridor_mission_title: "The Hexi Corridor"
 hnd_the_hexi_corridor_mission_desc: "The Hexi Corridor, a strip of traversable and arable land in the northwest flanked by hostile mountains and desert, is the most important trade route in northwestern China. It allows our merchants to export our goods to western lands through the Silk Road and also serves as to connect the Chinese heartland with the Western Regions of Tocharia and Ferghana through the Yumen Pass, also known as the Jade Gate for its significance in trade. Thus, let us secure the various cities and trading posts along the Hexi Corridor for our economic interests."
 hnd_expand_the_great_wall_mission_title: "Expand the Great Wall"
 hnd_expand_the_great_wall_mission_desc: "Along our northern frontier stands several walls dating back to the Warring States period - the Qin also consolidated these walls and constructed a Great Wall to defend the lands of northern China from nomadic raids. Let us continue what previous kings and emperors have started by expanding the Great Wall to greater heights and lengths never before seen by neither earth nor heaven."
 hnd_land_of_abundance_mission_title: "Land of Abundance"
 hnd_land_of_abundance_mission_desc: "The founder of the Han dynasty, Emperor Gaozu of Han, declared himself the ‘King of Han’ in Hanzhong and first ruled over the lands of Yi Province during the Chu-Han Contention, in which he defeated King Xiang Yu of Chu to become the sole ruler of China. The regional capital of Chengdu since before the Han was considered the Land of Abundance, and Emperor Gaozu also considered it a key breadbasket. Despite this legacy, much of the lands of Yi Province are considered untamed frontier, especially the deep southwest. Thus, let us continue to develop the far reaches of Yi and cultivate our breadbasket in the southwest."
 hnd_religious_harmony_mission_title: "Religious Harmony"
 hnd_religious_harmony_mission_desc: "While Confucianism and Daoism dominate much of the Han Chinese heartland, there are many local folk religions across the realm, from the lands north of Chang’an to the lands far south in Yizhou and Jiaozhi. Thus, it would be beneficial for us to introduce Confucian values to the far reaches of our empire while also allowing our peoples to practice their local traditions and respect their ancestors’ heritages."

Our ruling monarchs have dealt with assassinations, many of them successful - thus, let us win over the nobles and generals so they shall remain loyal, loyal enough for them to never side with any treacherous royal scions who wish for our ruler's downfall."
 fun_warriors_of_the_moon_mission_title: "Warriors of the Moon"
 fun_warriors_of_the_moon_mission_desc: "Our rulers are part of what is known as the Lunar dynasty, which is itself descended from our kingdom's founder, Queen Soma, with 'Soma' meaning 'Moon' in Sanskrit as well as sharing the name of the Hindu god of the Moon. The dynasty was founded when the Indian Brahmin Kaundinya arrived in Funan and impressed Queen Soma with his bravery, resulting in their marriage and the creation of the Lunar dynasty and the Funanese kingdom. Although we are a seafaring people, let us safeguard our kingdom and the dynasty of the Moon by establishing a mighty army led by skilled generals."

 fun_subjugate_the_pyu_mission_desc: "The city states of the Pyu have thrived since long before our own kingdom of Funan was established. The Pyu cities and their domain are themselves part of an overland trade route between India and China, the two major trading partners of our own kingdom of Funan. Thus, we would greatly benefit from the acquisition of the Pyu cities' fealty to the Funanese [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 fun_kings_of_vanga_mission_title: "The Rajas of Vanga"
 fun_kings_of_vanga_mission_desc: "The kings of Vanga were notable players in the Mahabharata, and their kings today rule through a great army, mighty elephants and a powerful navy. Our ambassadors have exchanged gifts and goodwill with the Vanga kings - however, if we wish to achieve our ambitions in the west, we will have to adjust our relationship of friendship with the Vanga rulers to a new relationship of overlord-and-subject."
 fun_union_with_kalinga_mission_title: "Union with Kalinga"
 fun_union_with_kalinga_mission_desc: "We have had extensive diplomatic relations with Kalinga, exchanging embassies with the kings of Kalinga and learning much from their Brahmins - the first king of Funan, Kaundinya, was himself a Kalingan Brahmin merchant. With our empire expanding into India, the Kalingans would be better off under our protection - thus, let us unite the kingdoms of Kalinga and Funan under our great king."
 fun_hindu_temples_mission_title: "Build Hindu Temples"

While there are many cultures and peoples in Funan, we must ensure that all of them adhere to the proper virtues of the world."
 fun_hegemonize_the_mon_mission_title: "Hegemonize the Mon"
 fun_hegemonize_the_mon_mission_desc: "If we wish to monopolize the gulf seas, we must conquer the Mon peoples of the gulf coast. The Mon live in a collection of cities and villages along the great river of the west, and the Mon had migrated to these lands alongside our own people countless centuries ago. Should we subjugate these neighbors of ours, the Mon would benefit greatly from the security, prosperity and stability of the great kingdom of Funan."

 fun_conquer_sudhammapura_mission_desc: "The kingdom of Sudhammapura has existed since the times of the Buddha himself and is another neighboring power that threatens our regional hegemony. The rulers of Funan have long eyed the Sudhammapura kingdom and its coastal cities for their trade value in the Bengal trade - let us therefore muster our armies and march westward towards Sudhammapura and the Bay of Bengal."
 fun_march_to_arakan_mission_title: "March to Arakan"
 fun_march_to_arakan_mission_desc: "The coastal cities of Arakan beyond Sudhammapura are our next step towards obtaining a monopoly over the eastern Bay of Bengal trade routes. As the crossroads between India and Suvarnabhumi, the peoples of Arakan were among the first to be Indianized in Southeast Asia. Let us therefore make the Arakanese subjects of Funan not only for their ports and markets but also as common followers of the Dharma."

Thus, as rulers of a new empire stretching from Vyadhapura to Vanga, it is only fitting for us to claim the neighboring city for ourselves so we may display our prestige, legitimacy and martial might to all of the world!"

 fun_invite_the_brahmin_mission_desc: "The founding king of our dynasty Kaundinya was a Brahmin merchant from Kalinga - thus, our own ruling dynasty is inextricably linked with the legacy of the Brahmins. Furthermore, the Brahmins are well-learned scholars, studying a range of topics including theology, statecraft, mathematics, science and literature. Thus, our kingdom would benefit greatly from inviting talented Brahmin from across the seas to contribute to the development of Funan."
 fun_indian_immigration_mission_title: "Indian Immigration"
 fun_indian_immigration_mission_desc: "Stronger ties with Indians across the seas and close cooperation with the Brahmin caste of Kalinga and other Indian regions have led to an increased influx of immigrants from India. These immigrants come from a variety of backgrounds - whether they are ambitious merchants, curious scholars or commoners just seeking a better life, let us make it clear that they are welcome in our ever-growing kingdom by turning the Funanese heartland into a shining beacon of prosperity and security."
 fun_legacy_of_the_naga_mission_title: "Legacy of the Naga"
 fun_legacy_of_the_naga_mission_desc: "Our founding queen, Queen Soma, was a member of the Naga, or 'Serpent,' dynasty, and all of our rulers are descended from the Naga bloodline. As a result, the divine Naga serpent plays a major role in Funanese and Khmer iconography. We must ensure the longevity of the Naga dynasty by laying the foundations for stable rule before we dispatch our armies too great of a distance beyond the Funanese heartland."
 fun_vanquish_the_cham_mission_title: "Vanquish the Cham"
 fun_vanquish_the_cham_mission_desc: "The Cham and their fleets, which include both royal and privateer ships, are a major threat to our naval hegemony in the gulf sea. A seafaring peoples skilled in the art of naval warfare just like ourselves, the Cham have long been rivals of Funan. Thus, the subjugation of the Cham would not only keep our kingdom safe from Cham raids but also grant us access new trading ports as well as the naval expertise of our new Cham subjects."
 fun_control_tonkin_mission_title: "Control Longbian"
 fun_control_tonkin_mission_desc: "The city of Lonbian in the Yue region has served as a regional capital for both the Viet and Chinese peoples - it was a capital of independent Yue rulers, and it has also served as a regional capital for the Han Chinese empire for Jiaozhi Commandery. Situated along the Red River, the city of Longbian and its surrounding domains would grant us greater influence over the southern Chinese trade routes should they ever come under our control."
 fun_chinese_campaign_mission_title: "Grand Han Campaign"
 fun_chinese_campaign_mission_desc: "As with all diplomatic relations, friendship stands only when it serves to benefit both parties - few rulers would hesitate to jump at an opportunity for glory, wealth and power the moment their former friend becomes weak. Thus, should the great empires of the Han ever crumble from within, we would have the golden opportunity to launch a grand campaign from the Red River Delta in order to secure key ports and cities of interest in the Middle Kingdom."

Thus, with external threats such as the rump states of the Greeks and other ambitious powers of the eastern Mediterranean all eyeing the lands of Hellas, perhaps it would be wise for us to proactively integrate Attica and Morea so we may bring them under our protection as well as directly employ the crusaders charged with defending them."

However, as we continue to expand further and further east towards the lands of Egypt and Syria, we have found that relying solely on the Kutama is not enough. Thus, we have begun recruiting Turkish ghulam, slave soldiers who serve as our infantry while the Kutama serve as our cavalry. These ghulam have quickly occupied high positions in the state, serving as prominent generals, officials governors - thus, it is important for us to keep these Ghulam loyal to our righteous and holy cause."

 fat_appeal_to_the_dhimmi_mission_desc: "Although we are of the Shia faith, since its foundation the Fatimid Caliphate understood that we are but only one religious group in a land that otherwise is home to many Sunni, Christian and Jewish communities.

Let us therefore continue to seek talent from the dhimmi of our lands and establish a true meritocracy."

 fat_viceroy_of_italiya_mission_title: "Viceroy of Italiya"
 fat_viceroy_of_italiya_mission_desc: "While we have acquired many valuable territories in the Italian peninsula, it will be difficult for our state to directly govern its lands from across the Mediterranean Sea. Thus, much like how we have established a viceroy in Ifriqiya to govern the lands of Ifriqiya on our behalf, it may be wise to establish a loyal viceroy or subject in Italiya who shall support us in times of war and fund our treasury through tribute in times of peace."

 fat_awliya_allah_mission_desc: "The Awliya' Allah are the 'Friends of God,' a name granted to those who converted to the Isma'ili doctrine of Shia Islam during the early days of the Fatimids, when Isma'ilism was still an underground movement waiting for the perfect moment to bloom in full. Thus, let us continue to acquire new subjects who shall swear allegiance to us both politically and religiously."

Having ascended as the true and righteous Caliphs guided by God, it is our duty of us Fatimids to shield all of the Shias from harm, whether they be Isma’ili or follow another branch of Shia Islam."

 fat_lord_of_ifriqiyah_mission_desc: "Throughout history, the lands of Ifriqiyah have been a center of prosperity - the land thrived under the rule of Carthaginians during ancient times, and Ifriqiyah was also the primary breadbasket of the Roman Empire at its height. As our revolution also began in these lands, it is imperative that we ensure the lands of Ifriqiyah remain prosperous and stable under the wise rule of our Caliph."

 fat_palaces_of_tunis_mission_desc: "Tunis is home to various cities and regional capitals built by the Fatimid Caliphs, along with various other cities that were sponsored and greatly expanded upon by the Caliphs. Thus, it would be wise for us to continue sponsoring and expanding these key cities so we can ensure the prosperity of Tunis even if we shall no longer use it as the seat of our empire in the future."

 fat_fleet_of_the_khalifa_mission_desc: "Much of our wealth and stability comes from our strong navy, as we can utilize our fine fleets to wage war, protect trade and defend our ports from piracy. Furthermore, the Fatimid navy is one of the few standing navies in the world. To achieve naval supremacy in the Mediterranean, we must therefore continue to fund and expand the Fatimid navy."
 fat_landfall_in_siqilliya_mission_title: "Landfall in Siqilliya"
 fat_landfall_in_siqilliya_mission_desc: "When we overthrew the Aghlabid dynasty that ruled Ifriqiyah on behalf of the Abbasids, the domain of Sicily also fell under our control. However, the Emirs of Sicily have not all proven themselves fully loyal to the cause of our great revolution. Let us therefore ensure that Sicily remains a Fatimid holding so we can continue to project our influence in the Mediterranean and into the peninsula of Italy itself."
 fat_mediterranean_powerhouse_mission_title: "Mediterranean Powerhouse"
 fat_mediterranean_powerhouse_mission_desc: "The powerful Fatimid navy has allowed us to protect and project our trade networks far beyond the shores of Ifriqiyah and Egypt, with our merchants engaging in markets across the Mediterranean and Indian Oceans, and with trade and diplomatic ties as far as China. It is therefore imperative that we develop our fleet into a naval powerhouse unrivaled in all of the Mediterranean so we may fill our coffers and realize our overseas ambitions."
 fat_secure_the_red_sea_mission_title: "Beyond the Red Sea"
 fat_secure_the_red_sea_mission_desc: "While the Red Sea trade has contributed greatly to our treasury as well as the overall prosperity of our empire and its peoples, we must look beyond the Red Sea and search for other opportunities if we wish to continue expanding our empire's borders into Africa and Asia. Thus, let us reach out to the easternmost lands of Arabia and become a dominant trading power in the Indian Ocean."
 fat_unify_bilad_al_arab_mission_title: "Unify Bilad al-'Arab"
 fat_unify_bilad_al_arab_mission_desc: "Bilad al-'Arab means 'Land of the Arabs,' the homeland of the Arab peoples and the birthplace of the Prophet Muhammad and Islam itself. Thus, as the Arab peoples expand far and wide beyond the Arabian peninsula into faraway lands such as Africa and Iberia, the homeland of the Arabs will continue to hold great significance. Many different tribes, kingdoms and peoples rule Arabia, disunited since the decline of the Abbasids and their false Caliphs. By reuniting all of the Land of the Arabs, we will earn the recognition of Arabs from across the world."

In order to efficiently run such a large empire, however, it is imperative that we appoint talented administrators and officials to run our bureaucracy. With an efficient bureaucratic state and a loyal and talented vizier serving as the intermediary between the Caliph and the empire, we will be able to rule over a vast realm with little issue."

 fat_cash_crop_agriculture_mission_title: "Cash Crop Agriculture"
 fat_cash_crop_agriculture_mission_desc: "Since the times of the Roman Empire, Egypt had served as the breadbasket of the Mediterranean, with grain being its primary cash crop - the grain of Egypt was what fueled the armies and conquests of Rome. Other cash crops of Egypt include cotton and sugar cane. Since the rule of the Tulunid dynasty of Egypt, however, grain has been overtaken by flax as the main cash crop of the region. Flax, from which linen fibers for Fatimid textiles are made, has allowed for the expanded export of linen, a trade that now drives the entire Egyptian economy. Besides the export of flax, flax also has high local demand, as textiles produced in Fatimid Egypt are among the finest in all of the world, and production centers of Fatimid textiles are of worldwide renown."
 fat_kutama_berbers_mission_title: "Call Upon the Kutama"
 fat_kutama_berbers_mission_desc: "The Kutama Berbers have always been an important part of the Fatimid army since before our Caliphate was officially declared. It was the Kutama who converted to Isma'ilism and supported our founder, Caliph Abd Allah al-Mahdi Billah, making up the bulk of the army that destroyed the Aghlabid emirate and thus allowed the Fatimid Caliphate to establish its base in Ifriqiyah. Since then, the Kutama have become an elite within our army and government. It would be therefore wise to call upon these brave and devout warriors once more to support our Caliph on the battlefield."
 fat_makurian_relations_mission_title: "Makurian Relations"
 fat_makurian_relations_mission_desc: "Due to our religious beliefs being significantly different from the majority-Sunni Islamic World, there are few potential allies for us in the Muslim world. Thus, in the past our Caliph instead turned south to the Christian Nubians of Makuria and established long-lasting peace and cooperation with the kingdom of Makuria. Our armies also depend on this relationship, as slaves provided by Makuria are used to man the Fatimid army. Us two powers also engage in other trades, as we export wheat, wine, and linen to the Nubians while importing ivory, cattle, ostrich feathers and slaves from Makuria."
 fat_spread_the_dawa_mission_title: "Spread the Da'wa"
 fat_spread_the_dawa_mission_desc: "The Da'wa, the doctrine of Isma'ili branch of Shia Islam, is the primary doctrine of our state. Although we Fatimids have always practiced a policy of religious tolerance towards both Sunni and Dhimmi, we shall always pursue our initial goal of spreading the true doctrine among the world. Although we have established an organization structured specifically for the promotion of Isma'ili doctrine, the majority of the people of Egypt continue to stick to their Sunni beliefs. It is therefore imperative that we continue our holy path and enlighten our subjects of the true doctrine of Islam."
 fat_custodian_of_the_holy_cities_mission_title: "Safeguard the Holy Cities"
 fat_custodian_of_the_holy_cities_mission_desc: "The holy cities of Mecca and Medina are of great significance to Islam, and countless devout Muslims embark on the pilgrimage to the holy cities and the Kaaba in Mecca every year. These pilgrims and holy sites of Hejaz, however, are not safe from harm. Thus, let us bring Mecca and Medina as well as the surrounding territories under our protection."
 fat_arabian_expansion_mission_title: "Arabian Expansion"
 fat_arabian_expansion_mission_desc: "The states of Yemen have benefited from the lucrative trade with India, Africa, Persia and the Mediterranean for centuries. However, the people of Yemen have not known unity and stability since the time of the Himyarites, predating the spread of Islam in Yemen. Thus, let us restore prosperity and stability in Yemen by placing them under our direct control and protection."
 fat_subdue_the_qarmatians_mission_title: "Subdue the Qarmatians"
 fat_subdue_the_qarmatians_mission_desc: "Although the Qarmatians are Isma'ili Shia Muslims like us, they rejected our Caliph as the true imam. As if rejecting our Imam-Caliph is not enough of an insult, the insolent Qarmatians continue to harass and raid our towns and cities as well as target pilgrims traveling to holy sites. Let us therefore put them in their place and remind them that our Caliphate is not to be defied."
 fat_legacy_of_the_first_imam_mission_title: "Legacy of the First Imam"
 fat_legacy_of_the_first_imam_mission_desc: "Our dynasty of Caliphs is directly descended from Imam Ali, the first Imam of the Shia faith, and his wife Fatimah, the daughter of the Prophet Muhammad. It is through this lineage that we are able to rightfully claim the title of Caliph. Although we have always referred to ourselves as the Alid dynasty, our rivals as well as hostile Sunnis and other non-believers refuse to recognize our legitimacy. If we have to lead our revolution to restore the borders of the Caliphate under Ali, none shall remain to question our claim to the Caliphate."

 fat_codification_by_the_jurists_mission_title: "Codification by the Jurists"
 fat_codification_by_the_jurists_mission_desc: "We Fatimids are leading a grand revolution against the pretenders who falsely claim the title of Caliph. We have therefore promoted our Isma'ili Shia doctrine among our subjects and neighboring lands beyond our Caliphate's borders. However, our Isma'ili currently lacks a single legal code that all of the Fatimid peoples can rely upon for maintaining piety and order in the Caliphate. Thus, it may be wise to heed the wise words of the jurists of our empire so we may compile a proper written legal code for our one true doctrine."
 fat_egyptian_ambitions_mission_title: "Egyptian Ambitions"
 fat_egyptian_ambitions_mission_desc: "Although our primary goal is taking the city of Baghdad and vanquishing the false Caliphs of the Abbasid dynasty in the east, we will need to establish a firm foothold in Egypt and Syria before we can launch a proper invasion into the heartland of Iraq. Thus, let us take our first step towards our ambitions and take control of the key cities of Alexandria and Fustat in Egypt."
 fat_imam_caliph_of_egypt_mission_title: "Imam-Caliph of Egypt"
 fat_imam_caliph_of_egypt_mission_desc: "Our ruler is known as the Imam-Caliph, as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is both the Imam, the infallible leader of the Shia Muslims, as well as the Caliph, the successor of Muhammad and the leader of the entire Islamic community. However, most of the population of Egypt is Sunni and does not recognize our ruler as the true Imam-Caliph, at least not truthfully in their hearts. It is therefore imperative that we promote the true doctrine among the peoples of Egypt."
 fat_hegemon_of_syria_mission_title: "Hegemon of Syria"
 fat_hegemon_of_syria_mission_desc: "The thriving lands and cities of Syria are the stepping stone from which we can launch an invasion into the lands of the Tigris and Euphrates and therefore complete our goal of seizing Baghdad from the false Caliphs. We have bided our time and built up our forces, incorporating loyal Kutama Berbers and ghulam alike in preparation for the campaign into Syria. The time has come to march our armies north from Egypt and defeat our rivals in Syria, whether they be Abbasids or Romans."

 fat_ismaili_mosques_mission_desc: "Besides fulfilling their role as places of worship, mosques built by the Caliphate itself are symbols of caliphal political and religious authority. The mosques' grandeur diplays to all the wealth and prosperity of the empire, and their elegance and beautifully-constructed features also serve a testament to the religious devotion of the Caliph and his subjects. Furthermore, Fatimid mosques are renowned for having greater complexity in design compared to mosques built by other dynasties in the Islamic World, and as a result Fatimid architecture and art has become prestigious on the world stage."
 fat_patron_of_the_arts_mission_title: "Patron of the Arts"
 fat_patron_of_the_arts_mission_desc: "Fatimid art is renowned across the world for its exquisite quality of both craftsmanship and materials. The prosperity of our Caliphate has furthermore triggered prosperity among the upper classes of Fatimid society, leading to increased patronage of the arts and the creation of opulent and fine objects such as carved rock crystals, lustreware ceramics, wood and ivory carvings, good jewelry, textiles and decorated books. These items are used not only for personal wealth but also to curry favor abroad, with fine gifts sent by our diplomats as far as the imperial court of China."

 fat_descendants_of_fatima_mission_desc: "The Caliph and the Fatimid dynasty are descended from Fatima, the daughter of the Prophet Muhammad, and her husband Ali, the first Shia imam. Thus, we carry an incredibly prestigious and holy legacy with our bloodline, a legacy that our future generations shall continue to carry with them. Thus, let us never forget the martyrs of our Shia faith and continue moving forward as pious and devout followers of God."

 fat_develop_al_qahira_mission_desc: "Known in Arabic as al-Qahira, or 'the City Victorious,' Cairo was envisioned as a grand city that would inspire awe in all who see it and are worthy to enter its walls. As a city built by the Fatimid dynasty itself, it is imperative that we develop al-Qahira into a beacon of prosperity that is unparalleled by any city in the Islamic World - as a new city built by our own hands, the city’s status shall reflect upon our own greatness."
 fat_al_azhar_university_mission_title: "Al-Azhar University"
 fat_al_azhar_university_mission_desc: "The al-Azhar Mosque in Cairo was constructed by our Fatimid dynasty and has quickly become a religious center of Egypt. The mosque does not serve solely religious purposes, however, as the al-Azhar Mosque has expanded into a center of learning that is notable in not just Egypt but also the entire the Islamic World. Furthermore, the mosque plays a significant role in preserving the legacy of the Fatimids, as the mosque is named after 'az-Zahra,' meaning 'the Shining One,' the title given to Fatimah, the daughter of the Prophet Muhammad from whom we are descended. Let us therefore expand the Mosque into a religious and intellectual complex by adding a library with thousands of manuscripts and refurbishments such as domes, arches and minarets."

Let us continue to build trade networks and pursue lucrative ventures as they appear so we may establish ourselves as a regional trading powerhouse."
 zab_control_tokharistan_mission_title: "Control Tokharistan"
 zab_control_tokharistan_mission_desc: "The neighboring region of Tokharistan is made up of two hundred and twelve kingdoms, governors and prefects, and various powers such as the Yabghus who were once our overlords. If we wish to survive in an age of ambitious empires and religious strife, we must expand into neighboring territories and seize Tokharistan for the Zunbil dynasty."
 zab_tokharians_of_the_tarim_mission_title: "Tokharians of the Tarim"
 zab_tokharians_of_the_tarim_mission_desc: "The cities of the Tarim Basin are valuable due to their geographical location - residing in oases of the Tarim desert, the cities have served as ideal waystations for merchants and travelers of the Silk Road for centuries.\n\nThough our Imperial Hephthalite forefathers once obtained their tribute, the cities had since fallen under the control of the Turkic Khaganate as well as the Tang Empire of China. Should the empires ever lose their grip over the Tarim, it would be beneficial for us to seize these oasis cities for ourselves."
 zab_avenge_the_sassanids_mission_title: "Avenge the Sassanids"
 zab_avenge_the_sassanids_mission_desc: "When the Sassanid Empire of the Persians fell to the Islamic Caliphs, we Zunbils had quickly raised up arms in an attempt to invade Persia and seize the lands from the Islamic rulers. However, our army was defeated and retreated to the lands of Zabulistan. Today, while the Islamic empires continue to dominate the western lands of Persia, we shall prove that our resolve and fervor is ever stronger than theirs. Thus, let us avenge the Zoroastrian Sassanids and lead another grand campaign into the heartland of Persia."

 zab_empire_under_the_sun_mission_desc: "Our Supreme God Zun is the Sun itself, and every day we Zunbils are blessed by the warm rays of the Divine and Great Zun. While we devotees of Zun have struggled to survive for generations, our faith in the Great Zun has finally paid off - we Zunbils now rule a vast empire, and we shall continue to strive towards ruling an empire of peace, prosperity and benevolence that is worthy of the Great Zun's blessed name."

 zab_cultivate_ghazni_mission_title: "Cultivate Zamindawar"
 zab_cultivate_ghazni_mission_desc: "The lands of Zamindawar are mountainous and thus naturally defensible; furthermore, its valleys are fertile and thus ideal grounds for growing a thriving kingdom. To compete with the rising cities of our neighbors, we must continue to develop and cultivate Zamindawar into a land that is worthy of Zun's blessings."
 zab_gatekeepers_of_india_mission_title: "Gatekeepers of India"
 zab_gatekeepers_of_india_mission_desc: "Our brave warriors stand strong in the face of the Islamic invaders, a force that not even the mighty Sassanid Empire could stand against. Thus, our fortifications in Zabulistan serve as one of few bulwarks defending the heartlands of India from the ambitious Caliphs of the west. Let us continue to grow and bolster our defenses in the highly-defensible lands of Khorasan so we may continue to rule on behalf of Zun."
 zab_rutbilid_banners_mission_title: "Rutbilid Banners"
 zab_rutbilid_banners_mission_desc: "Our great kingdom of the Zunbils was founded by Rutbil, brother of Tegin Shah of the Turk Shahis and descendant of the Imnperial Hephthalites. Ever since we split off from the Shahis, we have been fighting a defensive war against those who wish to subjugate us, our greatest threat being the Islamic empires of the west. Thus, let us raise the glorious banners of Rutbil and rally our armies to defend our homeland of Zabul."
 zab_cross_the_amu_darya_mission_title: "Cross the Amu Darya"
 zab_cross_the_amu_darya_mission_desc: "Just beyond the Amu Darya river is a city that has served as a vital center of commerce for countless generations. The city of Samarkand is as defensible as it is an important center of trade - sitting at the crossroads of numerous key trade routes, Samarkand is defended by four rows of defensive walls several miles long, with only four gates allowing merchants, residents and travelers to enter and exit the city. Thus, seizing this city would not only serve our economic interests but also add another key fortification from which we can wage war against the western invaders."
 zab_lord_of_sogdia_mission_title: "Lord of Sogdia"
 zab_lord_of_sogdia_mission_desc: "The lands of Sogdiana have long been a crossroads of trade and thus immense wealth, the Sogdians having been middlemen in the lucrative trade of the Silk Road for centuries. As we continue to expand beyond Zabulistan and to the north, the key cities of Sogdiana along with its exotic riches are now within reach."
 zab_governors_of_sistan_mission_title: "Governors of Sistan"
 zab_governors_of_sistan_mission_desc: "Since our Zunbil dynasty's very inception, we have long clashed with the Arab governors of Sistan who rule their lands on behalf of the Islamic Caliph. For many years, the forces of Sistan have attempted to conquer Zabulistan - upon failure, they instead resort to raiding and plundering our homeland. In response, we Zunbils have valiantly defended our homeland against their aggression until this day. To ensure the security of Zabul, let us muster our brave warriors and lead an unprecedented campaign against the Arab governor and bring Sistan under the protection of Zun."
 zab_iranian_restoration_mission_title: "Iranian Restoration"
 zab_iranian_restoration_mission_desc: "The lands of Iran were once Zoroastrian, and among the many Zoroastrian forms of worship was the Zoroastrian heresy of Zurvan, the god of infinite time and space, and a deity that has been identified with our own great god, Zun. Thus, by invoking Zurvanism among the Persian people and presenting Zun as another form of Zurvan for Zoroastrians or God for Muslims, we may have a chance at successfully syncretizing the faith of Zunism with the local faiths of Persia and therefore take another step towards our righteous goal of spreading the word of Zun across the land."
 zab_cities_of_zabulistan_mission_title: "Cities of Zabulistan"
 zab_cities_of_zabulistan_mission_desc: "Zabulistan is the homeland of the Zunbils, and its cities serve to ensure the survival of not only the Zunbil dynasts but also the faith of Zunism itself. Thus, it is imperative that we develop these cities into safe havens of security and abundance so that no devotee of Zun shall ever have to live in fear."
 zab_kingdom_of_the_khalaj_mission_title: "Kingdom of the Khalaj"
 zab_kingdom_of_the_khalaj_mission_desc: "Our ruling class is made up of Khalaj Turks, a group that had migrated to Zabulistan and gained hegemony over the local peoples after the fall of the Sassanid Empire. Today, our great Zunbil dynasty rules over a blend of cultures, with Turkic, Bactrian, Iranian and Indian subjects. Furthermore, our connections with the east have allowed us to incorporate cultural influences from China as well. Thus, while we are a dynasty of the Khalaj, our regional expansion cannot be achieved without the cooperation of many cultures and peoples under our banner of Zun."
 zab_shahis_of_kabulistan_mission_title: "Shahis of Kabulistan"
 zab_shahis_of_kabulistan_mission_desc: "The Turk Shahis of Kabul are cousins of our own Zunbil dynasty; our dynasty's founder Rutbil had split from the Turk Shahis, the Shahi's ruler at the time having been Rutbil's own brother. Thus, we have the justification to seize Kabulistan as rightful Zunbil land - the unification of Zabulistan and Kabulistan would also mean the greater likelihood of our peoples' shared survival in the face of powerful empires."
 zab_march_into_gandhara_mission_title: "March Into Gandhara"
 zab_march_into_gandhara_mission_desc: "Our Zunbil state is known as the gatekeeper of India, halting the armies of the Islamic Caliphates from making further gains into the heartland of India. This is a largely thankless role, however, with the blood of Zun's devotees spilled for unbelievers. Thus, by seizing the lands of Gandhara we would secure a new gateway through which we can expand further east into India."
 zab_king_of_punjab_mission_title: "King of Five Rivers"
 zab_king_of_punjab_mission_desc: "The lands of the Punjab, meaning 'five rivers,' has been a source of contention between various powers and empires throughout history. With our powerbase consolidated in the lands of Gandhara, we now have a foothold for further expansion into the rich provinces of Punjab."

 zab_indian_campaign_mission_desc: "With the riverlands of Punjab now under the control of the devotees of Zun, we have amassed a vast realm; our armies are great and mighty, our warriors unmatched in all of the world. With all of the chess pieces now in place, we Zunbils been divinely guided by the Great Zun on a grand campaign into India."

 zab_maharaja_of_hindustan_mission_desc: "The grand campaign in India is a success, and we have proven to all of India and its peoples that we are the ones chosen by the Great Zun to rule over all of the subcontinent. With such divine backing, it is only a matter of time before we Zunbils become the Great Kings of Hindustan."
 zab_shrine_to_zun_mission_title: "Great Shrine of Zun"
 zab_shrine_to_zun_mission_desc: "The primary Shrine of Zun, the solar god solely worshipped by the Zunbils, is seated atop a sacred mountain in Zamindawar. The shrine houses a golden statue of the god Zun Himself, embellished with gold and with eyes of rubies. As a result, Zamindawar and its shrine have become the most sacred holy site in all of Zunism. Let us expand this shrine into a great temple worthy of the great god Zun!"
 zab_zunist_temples_mission_title: "Sponsor Zunist Temples"
 zab_zunist_temples_mission_desc: "While the temple of Zamindawar on the sacred mountain of Zun is the most holy site in all of Zunism, we must construct more great temples across the realm if we wish to spread the true faith among the populace. Only then can we consider ourselves truly pious and devoted children of the Great Zun."

 zab_praise_the_sun_mission_desc: "The supreme deity Zun blesses us with His light, and in return we worship His Radiance with all of our being. To ensure the prosperity of our ruling dynasty, it is imperative that we spread the light of Zun among our subjects so that all may be blessed by the Great Zun."
 zab_recruit_the_ayyar_bands_mission_title: "Recruit the Ayyar Bands"
 zab_recruit_the_ayyar_bands_mission_desc: "The lands of Zabulistan as well as Greater Khorasan are home to various Ayyarun, mercenary bands of Ayyar vagabonds. Unlike many of the warriors who fight under the Islamic Caliphs, the Ayyarun have no permanent masters - although many of them follow Islam, they often find themselves fighting both for and against the Caliphal forces, as the Ayyarun fight for whoever is willing to recruit them. Thus, let us recruit the bands of Ayyarun who wander Zabulistan before our enemies have the chance to do so."
 zab_restore_taxila_university_mission_title: "Restore Taxila University"
 zab_restore_taxila_university_mission_desc: "The old university of Taxila in Gandhara was founded many, many centuries ago. Sitting at the crossroads of cultures and empires, the university of Taxila attracted scholars and students from across the realm. A variety of subjects were taught, from Vedic theological studies to linguistics, law, astronomy, medicine and mathematics. However, our cousins the Alchon Huns devastated the city, burning down its Buddhist monasteries and stupas, and the university was abandoned after the Alchon Huns' fall. With Taxila retaken, we have the unique opportunity of resuming a millenium-long legacy of higher education in Taxila."
 zab_seize_the_sindh_mission_title: "Seize the Sindhu"
 zab_seize_the_sindh_mission_desc: "We have always been a landlocked state, which has limited the resources and opportunities that are available to us. This can change should we ever obtain a port city along the southern coastline, the main waterway in our region being the Indus river. Used for transport as well as trade, obtaining the Indus river and its ports would be a great boon to our state."
 zab_shaivist_traditions_mission_title: "Shaivist Traditions"
 zab_shaivist_traditions_mission_desc: "The practices of Shaivism, the sect of Hinduism devoted to Shiva as their primary deity, is commonly practiced across India. Their traditions and perception of Shiva has been associated with our worship of Zun in the past, and it is commonly accepted by many that different deities may very well simply be different perceptions of the same deity. Thus, let us promote the acceptance and integration of Shaivist communities so they may also accept the light of Zun into their hearts."
 
 #RUM Sultanate of Rum
 rum_mediterranean_seaports_mission_title: "Mediterranean Seaports"
 rum_mediterranean_seaports_mission_desc: "Most of our territories gained in the early expansions of the Seljuks in Anatolia are inland. As much of the wealth of Anatolia is found beyond our core realm and along the Anatolian shorelines, it would be in our best interests to expand towards the sea and secure as well as develop key port cities along the Roman coast."
 rum_cultivate_port_alaiye_mission_title: "Cultivate Port Alaiye"
 rum_cultivate_port_alaiye_mission_desc: "The Anatolian port of the city Alaiye is one of many key ports along the southern coast. However, the city was known under the Greeks as 'Kalonoros', and our own great Sultan Alaeddin Kayqubad I had granted the city its new name 'Alaiye,' naming it after himself upon its conquest. Thus, let us develop the city named after a Sultan of Rum so it may stand above its neighbors in status, prosperity and prestige."
 rum_beyond_erzurums_gates_mission_title: "Beyond Erzurum"
 rum_beyond_erzurums_gates_mission_desc: "The city of Erzurum is a major city in our easternmost territories. Thus, it is from this city that we shall launch our campaigns further east towards the lands of the Caucasus and northern Mesopotamia. When the time is right, our armies shall march from Erzurum's gates to reclaim lands lost to the Seljuk dynasty as well as brand new territories in the east."
 rum_subjugate_the_georgians_mission_title: "Subjugate the Georgians"
 rum_subjugate_the_georgians_mission_desc: "The Christian kingdom of Georgia has continually resisted the will and might of the Seljuk dynasty as well as other great Muslim empires of history. A series of Seljuk-Georgian wars have been waged between us for generations - with the Seljuk dynasty in shambles in Persia, it is up to we Seljuks of Rum to conclude these costly wars and subjugate the Georgian kings once and for all."
 rum_control_syria_mission_title: "Control Syria"
 rum_control_syria_mission_desc: "Syria was once one of many administrative divisions of the Great Seljuk Empire - however, today the lands of Syria have been lost to local dynasties, and Seljuk influence no longer spans across the region. As one of the last Seljuk dynasts, we Seljuks of Rum shall march upon Syria and retake its lands for ourselves."
 rum_end_to_the_crusades_mission_title: "An End to the Crusades"
 rum_end_to_the_crusades_mission_desc: "The holy land of the Levant and the city of Jerusalem were once in the firm control of the Seljuk dynasty before the Christians in the west declared a holy war and seized the Levant in their so-called 'crusade,' massacring many of our fellow Muslims in the region. Now that we have established a foothold in Syria, we have the opportunity to defeat the crusaders and reclaim the Levant in a just war of reconquest and retribution."
 rum_egyptian_campaign_mission_title: "Egyptian Campaign"
 rum_egyptian_campaign_mission_desc: "When we Seljuks tore across the lands of Persia and Mesopotamia, the Fatimids of Egypt were in decline. Although we had intended to ally with the Fatimids of Egypt against the crusaders, negotiations broke down, and now both the Levant and Persia have been lost. With the Levant retaken, perhaps Egypt shall only cooperate with us if we seize its lands and peoples by force."
 rum_consolidate_cairo_mission_title: "Consolidate Cairo"
 rum_consolidate_cairo_mission_desc: "Although we have taken Egypt by force, we will never know true stability in Egypt until we consolidate our position in the regional center of Cairo. Thus, let us place a capable atabeg in Cairo and assist them in returning stability and prosperity to the land and people."
 rum_caravanserais_mission_title: "Caravanserais"
 rum_caravanserais_mission_desc: "The caravanserais of our realm serve as a vital part of Anatolian trade between our Sultanate of Rum and the world beyond our borders. While the caravanserais are used as trading posts, they also serve to defend caravans as well as allow information about foreign realms to pass into our hands. Due to their importance, the caravanserais have become notable landmarks in our realm."
 rum_roman_riches_mission_title: "Roman Riches"
 rum_roman_riches_mission_desc: "Now that we rule as Sultans in the Land of the Romans, it is only right that we also enjoy the economic prosperity and exotic riches once held by the once-mighty Roman Emperor in Constantinople. As we expand our political and economic sphere in Anatolia and the adjacent seas, our coffers shall become noticeably fuller than ever before, and thus our subjects shall also prosper."
 rum_armenians_of_cilicia_mission_title: "Armenians of Cilicia"
 rum_armenians_of_cilicia_mission_desc: "The Armenian kingdom of Cilicia has opposed us for many years, defying both Byzantine and Seljuk rulers alike. The kingdom has entrenched itself in Cilicia and consolidated its military and economic presence in the region. Thus, it will take some effort to fully conquer Cilicia and its cities; however, with Cilicia being a major crossroads of trade, the economic spoils of such conquest would be well worth our efforts."
 rum_besiege_aleppo_mission_title: "Besiege Aleppo"
 rum_besiege_aleppo_mission_desc: "The founder of the Sultanate of Rûm, Suleiman ibn Qutalmish, had attempted to besiege the city of Aleppo in hopes of seizing Syria from the Seljuk emir of Syria, Tutush I. In the ensuing battle, however, Suleiman was killed, and Suleiman's son Kilij Arslan were surrendered to Tutush. Fortunately, Kilij Arslan was able to reestablish the Sultanate of Rûm less than a decade later. With Cilicia secured, we now have the foothold from which we can avenge the death of Suleiman and seize the city of Aleppo as a stepping stone for further expansion in Syria and beyond."
 rum_iranian_ambitions_mission_title: "Iranian Ambitions"
 rum_iranian_ambitions_mission_desc: "The existence of our Sultanate of Rum as the last significant Seljuk power could only result from the collapse of Seljuk authority in Persia. Even in Anatolia, we have carried with us many Persian traditions and even Persian names. Thus, should we ever return to Persia as true Seljuk dynasts, it would be the symbolic first step towards the restoration of the Great Seljuks in the lands of Iran."
 rum_bulwark_of_islam_mission_title: "Bulwark of Islam"
 rum_bulwark_of_islam_mission_desc: "As a Muslim state surrounded by Christian rivals, we Seljuks of Rum are the bulwark of Islam, the last protectors of the Muslims in eastern Europe following the fragmentation of the Seljuk realm in Anatolia. It is therefore imperative that we strengthen our military and protect our borders not only for the survival of the Seljuk dynasty but also for the survival of the Islamic communities west of Syria."
 rum_march_to_baghdad_mission_title: "Long March to Baghdad"
 rum_march_to_baghdad_mission_desc: "One of the most notable events of the Great Seljuk dynasty was the acquisition of Baghdad and the Caliphate. However, with the Khwarezmid invasion and the restoration of Abbasid autonomy in Iraq, the city fell out of Seljuk hands. As we advance on our long march west, the grand city of Baghdad is one key city that we must retake for the restoration of Seljuk authority in Iraq."
 rum_seljuk_restoration_mission_title: "Seljuk Restoration"
 rum_seljuk_restoration_mission_desc: "Our relatively rapid rise to power in Persia has allowed our once-distant dreams of restoring the Great Seljuk Empire in Persia to now be within our grasp. With the momentum of conquest and the blessings of God on our side, let us reach for our dreams and tear across Persia with the famed Seljuk cavalry in the vanguard."
 rum_new_emirs_in_persia_mission_title: "New Emirs in Persia"
 rum_new_emirs_in_persia_mission_desc: "Even having reestablished Seljuk hegemony in Persia, there will surely be several local rulers and emirs who do not accept our rule. Thus, let us work hard to win over the emirs and establish ourselves as the sole hegemons of Persia."
 rum_palace_in_iconium_mission_title: "Grand Palace in Iconium"
 rum_palace_in_iconium_mission_desc: "The city of Iconium is the royal seat of the Seljuk dynasty. As we continue to grow in power, wealth and prestige, we shall need to continually renovate and expand the royal palace, as any palace in the world would be judged as a symbol of its royal family's opulence."
 rum_seljuk_architecture_mission_title: "Seljuk Architecture"
 rum_seljuk_architecture_mission_desc: "Blending Iranian and Byzantine styles as well as Armenian, Georgian, Syrian and Central Asian architectural styles, our Seljuk architecture is unlike anything that the world has ever seen, representing a blend of cultures that reflect the nature of our own sultanate. As we continue to expand our Sultanate of Rum, we must be sure to also spread our architectural legacy by constructing great and magnificent mosques, madrasas and caravanserais across the realm."
 rum_rally_under_the_eagle_mission_title: "Rally Under the Eagle"
 rum_rally_under_the_eagle_mission_desc: "The double-headed eagle of our standard was adopted by our Sultans of Rum, an ancient symbol dating back centuries and also adopted by other great powers such as the Romans. Our royal palaces are decorated with this eagle, and it is under this eagle that our brave soldiers of Rum fight. Let us therefore call upon the warriors of Rum to lend us their arms in battle, whether they be elite Turkish nobles or lower-class Anatolian levies."
 rum_recruit_the_ghilman_mission_title: "Recruit the Ghilman"
 rum_recruit_the_ghilman_mission_desc: "The Seljuk armies as well as the royal palace guard are bolstered by the ranks of the ghilman, enslaved youths taken from non-Muslim communities who serve in our armed forces. These ghilman are mostly taken from Greek communities that were once under the rule of the Byzantine Empire. Let us continue our expansion into non-Muslim territories so we may continue to bolster the ranks of our military."
 rum_askar_and_daylamite_mission_title: "Askari and Daylamites"
 rum_askar_and_daylamite_mission_desc: "The Askari are tribal warriors who serve as the cavalry and mounted archers in the Seljuk army. On the other hand, the Daylamites are Iranian peoples whose skill in infantry combat have prompted various Middle Eastern powers to recruit them to serve in their respective forces - the Daylamites themselves were able to establish their own powerful state as the Buyid dynasty, which fell to our ancestors the Great Seljuks. As we expand into new lands, it is essential that we focus on both infantry and cavalry so we may fight effectively on all terrains."
 rum_a_seljuk_empire_mission_title: "A Seljuk Empire"
 rum_a_seljuk_empire_mission_desc: "It has been quite a long time since the works 'Seljuk' and 'Empire' have been associated with one another, as the collapse of Seljuk authority in Persia and our wars with the Byzantines and Cilicians set the stage for what seemed like the end of Seljuk imperial hegemony. However, against all odds we Seljuks of Rum rose from the ashes of the fallen Seljuk Empire and now rule over an empire in our own right."
 rum_roman_aristocracy_mission_title: "Roman Aristocracy"
 rum_roman_aristocracy_mission_desc: "Although we Seljuk Turks are the undisputed rulers of our realm, the Greek aristocratic families still possess much influence. Thus, it would be wise to appease these Greek nobles to earn their loyalty as well as their willing service, as many of the Greeks are experienced in administration."
 rum_greek_administration_mission_title: "Greek Administration"
 rum_greek_administration_mission_desc: "Having earned the trust of the Greek aristocrats and administrators, we now possess a great amount of capable and loyal administrators in the former lands of the Roman Empire. Let us therefore continue adopting and adapting aspects of Roman and Greek administration as we see fit."
 rum_greco_persian_renaissance_mission_title: "Greco-Persian Renaissance"
 rum_greco_persian_renaissance_mission_desc: "Our culture and government are based on the Perso-Islamic as well as the Greco-Roman tradition. Thus, we have the rare opportunity of ushering in a new rebirth of the Greco-Persian blend of culture, similar to what was observed during the height of the Hellenistic period following the conquests of Alexander the Great. Thus, let us work towards developing our lands and minds so we may unite cultures from Persia and Greece together into a new cultural and intellectual renaissance."
 rum_the_land_of_the_romans_mission_title: "The Land of the Romans"
 rum_the_land_of_the_romans_mission_desc: "The name of our state, 'Rûm', is derived from the fact that our Sultanate rules in Anatolia, also known as the 'Land of the Romans.' While we have claimed the title of Sultan of Rûm, the Byzantine Empire to the west still contends with our armies for control of their former lands. To ensure our victory over the Byzantines, we must consolidate our position in Anatolia."
 rum_legacy_of_manzikert_mission_title: "Legacy of Manzikert"
 rum_legacy_of_manzikert_mission_desc: "At the Battle of Manzikert, the great Seljuk Sultan Alp Arslan dealt a devastating defeat to the Byzantine Empire - half of the Byzantine forces deserted, and their Turkic mercenaries defected to Alp Arslan, highlighting our Sultan's superior authority and backing by God. Furthermore, the Battle of Manzikert marked a significant turning point, driving the Byzantines into decline and allowing us Seljuks to push forward with the momentum to establish atabegs in Rûm. Thus, as our state of Rûm is itself the result of Alp Arslan's grand campaign, we shall continue his legacy by driving the Byzantines off the western shores of Anatolia and take one more step towards seizing all of the land of the Romans for ourselves!"

 rum_seize_the_roman_throne_mission_desc: "The city of Constantinople is also known as the City of the World's Desire, being the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire. As the Sultans of Rûm, capturing Constantinople, a city that has never fallen to foreign invasion, would greatly legitimize our rule as the Sultans of the Land of the Romans, paving the way for us to establish our own Seljuk empire in Hellas."
 rum_across_the_propontis_mission_title: "Across the Propontis"
 rum_across_the_propontis_mission_desc: "The Propontis is the sea dividing our territories in Anatolia from the mainland of Greece in the west. Now that we possess the city of Constantinople, we opened a path for a direct land invasion of Greece while fighting in our own ideal conditions on land and on horseback. Let us first target the lands of Thrace before we continue our march towards the historic heartland of Greece."

As legitimate successors of the Roman emperors of Constantinople, let us reunite the Greek lands and place their peoples under our protection."
 rum_rome_for_romans_mission_title: "Rome for Romans"
 rum_rome_for_romans_mission_desc: "Despite being the Sultanate of the Land of the Romans, the actual city of Rome is quite far from our reach. Even the Roman Emperors of Constantinople have not held Rome proper for centuries. As we continue to expand westward towards the central Mediterranean, each new conquest shall serve as but a stepping stone towards eventually capturing the Eternal City itself so the Seljuk dynasty may become proper Sultans of Rome."
 rum_messengers_of_islam_mission_title: "Messengers of Islam"
 rum_messengers_of_islam_mission_desc: "Unlike many of the more prominent Islamic powers of our time, we Seljuks of Rûm have the unique opportunity of expanding into new lands with little to no Muslim communities. This grants us a unique role as messengers of Islam in the west, spreading the true Islamic doctrine deeper into European lands that are historically Christian. Let us therefore invite more of God's children the Islamic community by expanding the borders of the Islamic World."
 rum_patron_of_persianization_mission_title: "Patron of Persianization"
 rum_patron_of_persianization_mission_desc: "Although it has been some time since we ruled in Persia, we Seljuks still retain many Persian traditions and customs. Persian governance and kingship still influence our system of rule, and Persian is still the official language of the court and country - even our Sultans and princes are given Persian names at birth."

 rum_greeks_of_trebizond_mission_desc: "The Black Sea to the north is also known in Greek as the 'Euxeinos Pontos,' meaning the 'Hospitable Sea' thanks to successful Greek Milesian colonization along its coasts many, many centuries ago. Among the most prominent port cities of the sea is Trebizond, a notable Byzantine city protected by notable fortifications. Trebizond itself is a major hub for trade between Europe and Asia, and the city is the main port through which Byzantine silks are shipped to Muslim markets to the east. It is therefore imperative that we seize the city if we wish to expand our economic and naval influence in the Hospitable Sea."

If we overextend our borders, it will be difficult to govern distant lands as well as keep them loyal. Thus, let us establish a sphere of vassals and tributaries who shall serve our best interests, a system similar to what the Chinese empires have maintained for generations."

 xib_cross_into_goryeo_mission_title: "Cross into Goryeo"
 xib_cross_into_goryeo_mission_desc: "While the lands of Korea have been a target for raids in the past, Korea also shares a deeper historical connection with our tribes. During our wars with the Xiongnu, several Xianbei and Wuhuan families migrated to the lands of Korea, adopting Korean surnames such as Kim. Many of these Korean families today are descended from the Donghu tribes of the Xianbei and Wuhuan, and there are also several of Xiongnu descent in Korea as well. We therefore have the right to reunite these lost Xianbei and Wuhuan to their ancestral home through conquest."

As we expand our territories, we must also keep in mind this lucrative business and seek a monopoly over the silk trade."

 xib_develop_writing_mission_desc: "Although we initially had no script of our own, we have recently adapted the characters used by the Chinese into a written language of our own. With the Chinese letters phonetically representing the Xianbei language in script, we can now preserve knowledge and track information with greater efficiency. With a capable ruler or administration, we would be able to make the best of this new innovation."

The Donghu were forcefully split into the Xianbei and Wuhuan tribes after being defeated by the Xiongnu. To this day, our cousins still share the same language as us, and they also share many ideas and traditions that are similar to ours. Let us therefore reunite the Donghu descendants, Xianbei and Wuhuan, to bolster our forces for our inevitable wars with the Han Chinese."

 xib_seize_liaodong_mission_desc: "The relatively-sparse cities and fortifications of Liaodong serve as the northeasternmost frontier of the Han dynasty, and its generals and governors have defended the frontier from us and other nomadic tribes such as the Xiongnu for generations. Besides its military significance, Liaodong also serves as an economic bridge between the Han heartland and the northeast, with trade networks between Liaodong and the peoples of Korea as well as our own tribes. By seizing Liaodong, we would be taking our first steps towards invading the Han empire's core territories."

 xib_question_of_sinicization_mission_desc: "As we conquer more and more Chinese territories, we also acquire new Chinese subjects. While these Chinese subjects a class below our tribes in the social hierarchy, many [Root.GetAdjective] nobles have adopted Chinese customs and culture, with some even adopting Chinese surnames in place of the names held by their forefathers. Thus, perhaps it would be wise for us to allow this sinicization to occur so we may better integrate our Chinese subjects and be viewed by them as one of their own."

However, the Middle Kingdom is in turmoil, and with our armies at the gates of their capital it seems that Heaven and the great Tengri have instead chosen us as their celestial emperor on Earth."

Let us eliminate the shameful Chanyu of the Southern Xiongnu and liberate their people from the Han yoke."

 xib_bypass_the_great_wall_mission_desc: "For many centuries, we Xianbei have relied upon the defenses of the Xianbei Mountains, from which we earned our name 'Xianbei' in Chinese. However, as we have now expanded far and wide across the steppes, we have established an empire that can even challenge the Emperor of China. To the south, the Qin and Han dynasties constructed a Great Wall across their northern frontier. Therefore, we must make the first move and lead a grand offensive campaign to seize a foothold in Chinese lands on the other side of the Great Wall."

 xib_xianbei_emperor_mission_desc: "The Chinese people have long been ruled by a monarch calling themselves an 'Emperor.' With the conquest of the imperial capitals of Luoyang and Chang'an, we too would have the legitimacy to claim the title of 'Emperor,' proving to the world that the Han have lost the Mandate of Heaven, with the Heavens favoring instead our great [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] as the true Son of Heaven."

 xib_new_grazing_lands_mission_desc: "As a nomadic people, we are always in search of new grounds upon which our horses may graze. The best way of acquiring grazing lands is not through exploration but through conquest, as controlling a vast amount of grazing lands ourselves means we can graze and hunt in different zones throughout our realm, rotating between zones throughout the seasons."
 xib_flying_horses_mission_title: "Tame the Flying Horses"
 xib_flying_horses_mission_desc: "A prominent feature of Xianbei art is the flying horse, a winged horse depicted throughout Xianbei culture. Furthermore, our horses are faster and stronger than those of the Xiongnu, and we Xianbei were also among the first on the steppes to make use of the stirrup, an innovation that has allowed us to dominate on the battlefield. Let us continue this tradition of mounted warfare and utilize our horses and stirrup technology to their greatest potential."
 xib_supplant_the_chanyu_mission_title: "Supplant the Chanyu"
 xib_supplant_the_chanyu_mission_desc: "The Chanyu of the Xiongnu confederation has long been rivals to our tribe. Having driven our Donghu forefathers further and further east, the Xiongnu had established a great confederation in their own right. However, since they have been dealt defeat after defeat by the Chinese empire of the Han to the south, the Xiongnu have fallen into further and further decline. Let us therefore vanquish the Chanyu and replace them as the foremost powerhouse on the northern steppes."

While the autonomy wielded by each of these clans and their chiefs holds the confederation together, it also prevents further centralization and consolidation of power in the hands of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Let us therefore appeal to these clans in order to win their loyalty as well as bring them closer to direct subservience to our great [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 xib_centralize_tribal_authority_mission_title: "Centralize Authority"
 xib_centralize_tribal_authority_mission_desc: "Although we have replaced the Chanyu of the Xiongnu as the dominant power of the steppes north of the Chinese states, our Xianbei confederation is more decentralized in comparison to the confederation of the Xiongnu. Now that we have divided up our administration and reigned in the twenty prominent clans of the Xianbei state, we can now work towards the consolidation of authority for our high chief so their rule may more closely resemble that of a Chanyu, or even an emperor."

 xib_devastate_the_yuezhi_mission_desc: "The Yuezhi once lived in our lands before they were driven westward long ago by the Xiongnu and Wusun. After overrunning the Greek kingdom of Bactria, the Yuezhi tribes established their own kingdom in Bactria, ruled by the Yuezhi clan of Kushana. The Kushana have since declared themselves an empire, becoming a major power in the west. Let us humble these arrogant Kushana by laying waste to their cities and seizing their land and newfound riches for ourselves."

 xib_long_ride_to_lihai_mission_desc: "Although we have vanquished the Xiongnu confederation in our ancestral home region, there are rumors that descendants of the Xiongnu have migrated far west to lands near a sea known to the Chinese as 'Lihai.' These peoples are known to peoples in the far west as 'Huns.' As we expand our confederation westward, let us keep our history with the Xiongnu in mind as we pursue their descendants to the ends of the earth!"

 xib_northern_agriculture_mission_desc: "Our economic base relies primarily on animal husbandry as well as agriculture, the latter being especially important as we continue to expand further south into lands occupied by sedentary peoples such as the Han Chinese and the Koreans.

 xib_monuments_to_tengri_mission_desc: "As a result of architectural influences from China as well as from followers of the Buddhist faith, whose numbers have been increasing in our lands as of late, we have learned to appreciate the value of constructing temples and other religious monuments. Thus, as we establish more permanent settlments for agriculture, let us also erect stationary monuments and temples to the great Tengri."

 xib_conquer_the_wusun_mission_desc: "The Wusun are another formidable steppe people, having both allied with and fought against the Xiongnu in the past with notable success. Furthermore, the Wusun are located to the far west of our confederation and are thus only one of many stepping stones for our growing nomadic empire, one that we shall conquer and integrate into our confederation to fulfill greater ambitions."

 xib_subjugate_the_jushi_mission_desc: "The Tocharian city-states, known to the Chinese as the Jushi, have had a long history with the Han dynasty. During the War of the Heavenly Horses, Chinese generals advanced through the Tocharian cities to attack their primary enemies, the Dayuan. With the Dayuan defeated, the Chinese established the Protectorate of the Western Regions, placing a Han Protector-General that controlled the various Tocharian cities. Recently, the Han's grasp over these lands has weakened as they faced uprisings from the nearby Qiang and from within."

 xib_defeat_kangju_mission_desc: "The kingdom of Sogdiana, known to the Chinese as 'Kangju,' is ruled by nomadic tribes from the west, its kingdom made up of both sedentary cities and steppe settlements. Before the Kangju, there existed the Greek kingdom of Dayuan - however, Dayuan was defeated in the War of Heavenly Horses against the Han dynasty; this war resulted in the Han acquiring the famed Ferghana hanxuema, or 'blood-sweating horses,' an asset that allowed the Han to defeat their Xiongnu rivals in the north. With Ferghana under our control, these horses would also be ours."

 xib_a_new_trade_empire_mission_desc: "With the conquest of Sogdia and our dominance over the northern steppe, we control many vital points of trade between the east and the west, most notably the lucrative silk trade from China to the western kingdoms.

 pis_humble_the_fiorentinos_mission_desc: "The city of Florence and its citizens view us Pisans with utter contempt - it is safe to say that the feeling is mutual. The arrogant Fiorentinos not only disagree with us politically such as regarding the Investiture Controversy, with the Guelph Fiorentinos clashing ideologically against the majority Ghibellini Pisans. Furthermore, Florence has gradually been rising in prosperity and prominence as of late - it is our duty as proud Pisans to squash them before they become too much to handle and strike some humility into the Fiorentinos!"

 pis_usurp_the_margravi_mission_desc: "While the comune of Pisa is de jure a vassal of the Margravi of Tuscany, we have gained de facto political independence from the Tuscans, even gaining recognition from the Emperor. If we gain enough power and influence, perhaps we can even usurp the Margravi and become the hegemons of Tuscany, establishing our own league of cities as leaders of the new Tuscan League."

 pis_customs_of_the_sea_mission_desc: "While there is much debate between the Guelphs and the Ghibellines over the right of investiture, it can be agreed upon by almost all Pisans that the there are few besides the Pope and the Emperor themselves who possess the authority and diplomatic reputation to ordain the customs of the sea. Thus, should we win the backing of both the Emperor and the Papacy, the Pisan customs of sea and trade would surely be recognized as the standard customs of the western Mediterranean."

 pis_mare_nostrum_mission_desc: "To the Romans, the Mediterranean Sea was known as 'Mare Nostrum,' meaning 'Our Sea,' as the entirety of the Mediterranean was under the control of the Roman Empire.

Other families such as the Della Gherardesca, Caetani and Upezzinghi are similarly old and prominent. Furthermore, these aristocratic families all share a fear of being overshadowed by the rising merchant class, and they also continue to quarrel amongst themselves in personal feuds.

It is therefore clear to many that our government is still in need of reform, and that there is still much to do before we can establish a truly stable and impartial consulate that works only for the greater good."

 pis_great_galleys_of_pisa_mission_desc: "Our fleet is the main military force of Pisa, allowing us to project our authority and influence far beyond Italian shores and into distant lands such as Africa and the Levant. It is therefore imperative that we continue to bolster our fleet, commissioning only the finest of Pisan shipbuilders for the finest of Pisan galleys."

 pis_sardinia_et_corsica_mission_desc: "The islands of Sardinia and Corsica have long been contested between us and our rivals, whether they be the ambitious Genoese in the north or the Muslim emirs to the south. Meanwhile, the Judicates of Sardinia are also a major part of the struggle, with some of the Judicates wanting full autonomy, while others are more willing to work with foreign powers like us. Thus, let us use a combination of martial might, naval supremacy and cunning to bring all of Sardinia and Corsica under Pisan control."

With Alexandria only a few days away from our center of authority in Africa, perhaps Alexandria could become an emporium of Pisa."

The construction of temples and the educational and medical institutions around them serves as a projection of royal authority as a benevolent presence in the farther reaches of the kingdom. Thus, as we of the Chola dynasty have historically favored the worship of Lord Shiva as personal deities, let us continue building temples to Lord Shiva as well as various other gods."

 cls_brihadisvara_temple_mission_desc: "The Brihadisvara Temple is one of several Great Chola Temples in the heart of the Chola country.

However, the Chola king of Anuradhapura, Ellalan, was defeated and overthrown by the Lankan prince Dutthagamani Abhaya, who subsequently became king of a newly independent Anuradhapura. If we desire to reclaim the glory of our ancestors, we must cross Rama's Bridge and restore Chola suzerainty over the island of Lanka."

The Tamil king's trust is earned from the people through his belief in and adherence to Aram, which in turn legitimizes his rule and his royal decrees.

As we continue to build more cities in place of former villages, we grow our royal presence across our kingdom, establishing more direct control over the frontierlands of our realm. Thus, let us continue to inspire awe in foreign diplomats and envy in our rivals through the further urban expansion of the Chola capital."

 cls_one_honored_by_heaven_mission_desc: "One of the titles held by the three Tamil Kings of Chola, Pandya and Chera is the shared title 'Three Glorified by Heaven.' We are blessed by the gods not only in our military campaigns but also in our wealth - our lucrative spice trade makes up the majority of our income from exports, with merchants from lands as far as Rome, Persia and Arabia arriving at our ports for our goods. To ensure our stable rule, we must display to all, subjects and enemies alike, that we Cholas are divinely favored."
 cls_the_spice_must_flow_mission_title: "The Spice Must Flow"
 cls_the_spice_must_flow_mission_desc: "Much of our wealth comes from the lucrative spice trade, with the kings of Tamilakam having traded spices with the lands of Persia, Arabia, Africa and the Mediterranean for centuries. As we expand territorially, we must also consider the commercial value of the cities we acquire as well as potential avenues for the Tamil spice trade."

 cls_rajakesari_of_tamilakam_mission_desc: "For centuries, the land of Tamilakam has been shared between various kings and tribal chiefs, most notably the Three Crowns of Tamilakam: the Cholas, Pandyas and Cheras. However, should the Pandyas and Cheras along with the various local powers be united under the Chola dynasty, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] would have the authority and legitimacy to declare themselves the true Rajakesari, or 'Lion Among Kings,' of a united Tamilakam."

 cls_kingdom_of_dravida_mission_desc: "The Dravidian peoples have long been divided between various different kingdoms since as far back as the Kurukshetra War described in the Mahabharata, the great Hindu epic. However, our Chola dynasty has already united much of the Dravidian lands, expanding far beyond Tamilakam. Perhaps our dynasty shall be the first to rule over a united Dravidian kingdom ruled by Dravidian rulers."

 cls_reign_over_dakshinapatha_mission_desc: "The Dakshinapatha, meaning 'Southern Road,' is a name that also describes the entire realm of southern India. The Dakshinapatha itself is also the major trade route of southern India, being one of two great roads that connected different regions of India for centuries, the other road being the Uttarapatha, or 'Great Northern Road.' Before our time, the Satavahana king Satakarni adopted the title of 'Lord of Dakshinapatha' upon controlling the great road - this title would pass into our hands if we Cholas become the hegemons of the great road instead."
 cls_chola_empire_mission_title: "Usher in the Chola Empire"
 cls_chola_empire_mission_desc: "At many points in our history, the Chola dynasty could be described as an empire, and there would be few who would dispute such claims. We Chola, however, pride ourselves in ruling a vast maritime empire, controlling ports and trade cities that our ancestors could only imagine or may have never even heard of. Thus, let us prove to ourselves and the world that we are deserving of the title of emperor through the establishment of an eternal Chola Empire backed by the divine blessings of the Supreme Lord Shiva."
 cls_ally_the_vellalar_mission_title: "Ally the Vellalar"
 cls_ally_the_vellalar_mission_desc: "The Vellalar are the dominant secular aristocratic caste of society in Tamilakam, serving as the courtiers, most of the army officers, the lower-ranking bureaucrats, and the upper layer of the peasantry. Their name is derived from the title 'Vel', a title held by their Velir chieftain ancestors during the Sangam age. As a result, the Vellalar are incredibly influential across classes and are numerically strong. The Vellaikara, the special units of the king's armed forces, are also drafted from the Vellalar. Thus, it would be wise to ally with these aristocrats to ensure stability and loyalty among Chola society."
 cls_administrative_reforms_mission_title: "Administrative Reforms"
 cls_administrative_reforms_mission_desc: "Mandalams are the main administrative divisions of our kingdom. To ensure unity and stability, each mandalam is allowed to retain its own distinctive cultural identity and regional autonomy in exchange for loyalty to the Chola crown. As overlords of various local rulers and chiefs in Tamilakam, we must maintain this delicate balance between central authority and local autonomy."
 cls_tamil_golden_age_mission_title: "A Tamil Golden Age"
 cls_tamil_golden_age_mission_desc: "The rule of the Chola dynasty has often been described as a Golden Age of Tamilakam, though our critics are quick to point out our flaws.

 cls_the_waters_of_the_kaveri_mission_desc: "The Kaveri river is one of the Seven Holy Rivers of India and is the main river of our homeland in Tamilakam. Also known as the Ponni, or 'Golden,' River, the Kaveri is of great religious and cultural significance to the Cholas - the Kaveri is both a river and a goddess - while there are several different stories of its origin, among we Cholas it is said that the ancient King Kantaman of Chola's devotion to Brahma brought the Kaveri river into existence, fertilizing our lands and purifying the people."

 cls_land_of_the_andhras_mission_desc: "The Andhras have ruled many great kingdoms in history, and many great powers outside of the land of the Andhras have also warred to conquer the coastal cities of the Andhras for themselves. At the height of the Chola empire, the kingdoms of the Andhras as well as various kingdoms along the east coast of India from Tamilakam to the Ganges River all kneeled to the Chola, acknowledging our suzerainty as kings of the Indian shores."

 cls_raja_of_kalinga_mission_desc: "We have long competed with the kings of Odda and Kalinga for supremacy along the eastern coast of India, and our new northern acquisitions in the land of the Andhras have only increased tensions with our rivals in the north. While the kings of Odda and Kalinga surely view us as a great threat, their kingdoms shall only be stepping stones for greater heights as well continue to advance towards the holy waters of the Ganga, the most sacred river in all of the Hindu faith."
 cls_ganga_river_expedition_mission_title: "Ganga River Expedition"
 cls_ganga_river_expedition_mission_desc: "The Ganges River is the most sacred river in all of Hinduism. As we continue our unprecedented northern expansion beyond the lands of Andhra and Kalinga, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has considered taking a pilgrimage to the Ganges - and perhaps even taking [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] army with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to bring the local kingdoms under Chola control. The ambitious [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of the Cholas is even planning to take some of the sacred waters of the Ganga back to the Chola capital for storage in a great Cholaganga pillar of victory."
 cls_rule_the_twin_roads_mission_title: "Rule the Twin Roads"
 cls_rule_the_twin_roads_mission_desc: "With the Dakshinapatha, the Great Southern Road, now under the control of the Chola dynasty, we have become hegemons of one of the two great roads of India. As we continue to expand north, our courtiers and generals have advocated for the total conquest of the Uttarapatha, or Great Northern Road, as well. Being rulers of the main great roads of both the north and south would surely grant us unprecedented economic, political and cultural influence across all of the Indian subcontinent."
 cls_tenure_agriculture_mission_title: "Tenure Agriculture"
 cls_tenure_agriculture_mission_desc: "All cultivable land in our kingdom is held by three different classes of tenure, including peasant property known as vellan-vagai, service tenure and charitable tenure given as gifts to loyal subjects. The vellan-vagai villages pay either direct taxes to the government or dues to local temples and other public institutions. This allows us to gain greater oversight over the movement of funds and taxes, in turn allowing us to invest in irrigation and dams for further development of Chola agriculture, even constructing artificial lakes in the capital."
 cls_weaving_guilds_mission_title: "Weaving Guilds"
 cls_weaving_guilds_mission_desc: "Besides the spice trade, the textile industry is also very prominent in the Chola country. The weavers have become so numerous, skilled and organized that they have established weaver's guilds across the Chola country. To ensure that the guilds shall serve our own best interests, it would be wise to appease the weaving guilds and make them allies of the Chola crown."
 cls_royal_physicians_mission_title: "Royal Physicians"
 cls_royal_physicians_mission_desc: "Our Chola rulers have always been benevolent and altruistic patrons of hospitals and medicine, employing royal physicians that are dispatched far and wide to heal the sick and wounded across the Chola realm. Let us continue to employ wise and skilled physicians and scholars to bring peace, prosperity and good health to the good people of Tamilakam."
 cls_hegemonize_the_cheras_mission_title: "Hegemonize the Cheras"
 cls_hegemonize_the_cheras_mission_desc: "While the Chera dynasty is one of the Three Crowns of Tamilakam, the three most prominent and wealthy Tamil kings, the influence and power of the Cheras has been in decline. Despite their political decline, the Cheras still possess great wealth thanks to controlling the port of Muchiri, a major trade hub that links south India to the markets of Persia, Africa and beyond. For the interests of both the Cheras and us Cholas, let us place them and their trade city of Muchiri under our protection - whether they welcome our protection is of no concern to us."
 cls_twelve_thousand_islands_mission_title: "Where Three Waters Meet"
 cls_twelve_thousand_islands_mission_desc: "The Maldives Islands across the sea to the west was given the name Munnir Palantivu Pannirayiram by our Chola king, meaning 'Twelve Thousand Islands and the Ocean Where Three Waters Meet.' The islands themselves are ruled by their own kings, having a history of its own dating back several centuries, having inhabited the island during the Sangam period - Tamil literature from the Sangam period also refers the to islands as Munnir Pazhanthivam, meaning 'Older Islands of the Three Seas,' a testament to its old history - let us add to their history by subjugating the kings of the twelve thousand islands."
 cls_the_lord_of_tigers_mission_title: "The Lord of Tigers"
 cls_the_lord_of_tigers_mission_desc: "The lands of Vanga are known for their tigers - similarly, our Chola dynasty is also identified with tigers, with the Jumping Tiger serving as the royal emblem of our Chola kingdom. Another animal associated with Vanga is the elephant, as the Vanga kingdom has been skilled in handling war elephants since the ancient Kurukshetra War between the Pauravas and Kauravas - their fine war elephants continue to be praised by both Indian and foreign writers, having supplied their elephants to great powers in history such as the Mauryan Empire."

They turn to the Greek-translated Septuagint or the Aramaic Bible for theology, and Greek has become a common language in the eastern Roman territories. However, Hebrew continues to hold a great religious and historical legacy for our people and civilization, known to us still as the Lashon Hakodesh, or 'Holy Tongue.' Thus, it may be wise for us to promote its survival or, if the language's demise is inevitable, maintain Hebrew traditions in the face of foreign corruption."

 gog_chinese_diplomacy_mission_desc: "Our relationship with the emperors of China can be best described as complicated. Sometimes hostile and sometimes cordial, we have survived as an autonomous kingdom despite neighboring such a large empire through both warfare and diplomacy. Thus, let us continue sending ambassadors to the Chinese imperial court - not only to make peace, but also to learn their methods and systems that have allowed them to rule over a vast empire for so many generations."

Numerous heaven-worshipping rituals are performed in order to emphasize the divine nature of our dynasty so that our subjects may remain united, temporally and spiritually, under our ruler. Even so, much influence is in the hands of the shamans, whose magic powers allow them to serve as mediators between man and heaven. Even with the adoption of Buddhism as a state religious of our kingdom, Korean shamans continue to possess much influence. Thus, to consolidate our central authority and put an end to tribal factionalism, we must secure the backing of the shamans in establishing state religious institutions."

However, the kingdom fell to the Han dynasty, and the heartland of Gojoseon was divided into Four Commanderies of Han under their new Han dynasty overlords. Thus, for many generations, ambitious Korean rulers have waited for the perfect opportunity to retake these ancestral lands - should Han central authority ever falter, our Goguryeo cavalry shall storm the Four Commanderies and seize what is rightfully ours."

These five tribes possess much autonomy, with the kingdom's affairs divided between representatives from the five bu in a legislative body known as the Jega Council. Furthermore, the tribes also possess much cultural and religious influence.

 byz2_basileia_rhomaion_mission_desc: "For many generations, the legitimacy of our empire has been questioned by critics from both beyond and within the borders of our empire. As long as the western regions remain out of Roman hands, there shall always be pretenders who claim the lands of Rome, whether it be the ambitious Odoacer, the treacherous Goths or the arrogant Franks. However, the tide of history has already begun to turn, and soon all pretenders shall kneel before the might of a reunited Roman Empire."
 byz2_develop_the_themata_mission_title: "Develop the Themata"
 byz2_develop_the_themata_mission_desc: "With the great loss of territory to the Islamic invasions, we must find more efficient ways for raising troops. We have therefore granted state-owned land or tax relief to farmers and local citizens across the empire under the agreement that they shall serve in our armies whenever they are called upon by the strategoi in their respective thema, or theme. Let us continue to expand this theme system so we can more efficiently call upon our troops when faced by invaders on all fronts."
 byz2_grain_of_the_empire_mission_title: "Grain of the Empire"
 byz2_grain_of_the_empire_mission_desc: "With the vital breadbaskets of Carthage and Egypt lost to the Arab invasions, our supply of cereals to the general populace has greatly decreased. Coupled with plague and famine, the population of Constantinople and its suburbs has been halved since before Heraclius’ campaigns. To prevent further population decline and to support our great empire, we must put more effort into growing foodstuffs and taking advantage of surpluses as they come, without the reliance of grain shipments from beyond Nova Roma."
 byz2_compile_the_basilika_mission_title: "Compile the Basilika"
 byz2_compile_the_basilika_mission_desc: "Justinian's Corpus Iuris Civilis laid the foundation for the codification of Roman law. It has, however, been some time since it's compilation, and our new situation will require some adaptations and additions to Roman law. Thus, let us commission the extension of Roman code through the compilation of further works and laws."
 byz2_a_new_good_caesar_mission_title: "A New Good Caesar"
 byz2_a_new_good_caesar_mission_desc: "A realm is only as good, just and capable as its ruler. This is and has always been the case. Thus, a stable and secure empire is in need of a Good Caesar."
 byz2_varangians_of_the_rus_mission_title: "Varangians of the Rus'"
 byz2_varangians_of_the_rus_mission_desc: "The valiant warriors of the Rus' above the Black Sea have been recent friends of our court and state. As a result, there are some who wish to invite these warriors to fight under our own banners as impartial elite troops. Thus, let us continue to build good relations with the peoples of the region in the hopes of recruiting a capable force for the stability and security of our throne."
 byz2_anatolic_consolidation_mission_title: "Anatolic Consolidation"
 byz2_anatolic_consolidation_mission_desc: "While we were able to repel the Muslim invaders from much of Anatolia, we must consolidate our position and reclaim all of Anatolia before we can pursue greater ambitions of retaking other Roman territories such as Syria and Egypt."
 byz2_retribution_for_yarmuk_mission_title: "Retribution for Yarmuk"
 byz2_retribution_for_yarmuk_mission_desc: "The Battle of the Yarmuk was a decisive battle in which our Roman forces were devastated by the Muslim Rashidun Caliphate, marking a major turning point in the conflict that allowed the Levant and thus Egypt and Africa to fall into the hands of the Islamic invaders. With our forces no longer on the defensive, it is time that we avenge the tens of thousands of lives lost in the campaign along the Yarmuk River."
 byz2_protect_the_true_cross_mission_title: "Protect the True Cross"
 byz2_protect_the_true_cross_mission_desc: "The True Cross of Jerusalem was returned to Jerusalem by Heraclius, having retaken the holy relic from the invading Sassanid Persian Empire. However, this was shortly before the Islamic Caliphs invaded our lands and seized Jerusalem and the Levant from us. Though relics of the True Cross were spread across Christendom as far northwest as England, the True Cross shall never be truly safe until Jerusalem is once again returned to Christian hands."
 byz2_annexation_of_aegyptos_mission_title: "Annexation of Aegyptos"
 byz2_annexation_of_aegyptos_mission_desc: "With the Levant now firmly under our control, it is time that the wealthy and abundant lands of Egypt are reclaimed by our empire. Since Alexandreia possesses great significance and history in relation to our Christian faith, securing the city and restoring the Patriarchate of Alexandreia shall allow us to benefit in both religious and temporal realms."
 byz2_exarchatus_africae_mission_title: "Exarchatus Africae"
 byz2_exarchatus_africae_mission_desc: "Though Justinian had retaken the breadbasket of Rome from the Vandals, the cities of Africa were lost once more due to the Islamic invasions. However, with our position in the east secure, we can now look further west and follow the footsteps of Justinian and Belisarius in retaking Africa."
 byz2_avenge_the_altavans_mission_title: "Avenge the Altavans"
 byz2_avenge_the_altavans_mission_desc: "The Mauri of Altava were among the last Christian forces to resist the Islamic invasion of Africa. While they were ultimately defeated, they shall be remembered as honorable subjects of Rome. Thus, with Africa retaken by our forces, we can now avenge the Altavans by driving the heathen forces from Numidia and Mauretania."
 byz2_merchant_guilds_mission_title: "Merchant Guilds"
 byz2_merchant_guilds_mission_desc: "Trade in Constantinople is run by various hereditary guilds that are subsidized by the government. As a result, the merchants of our capital enjoy several privileges such as significantly reduced duties and tolls. Even so, in Byzantine society, merchants are often distrusted by both officials and the general populace. Thus, we have put in place standards for weights, measures and prices to strictly regulate trade. Furthermore, we avoid corruption in this system by appointing kommerkiarioi, officials who collected duties, for only one year before they are moved elsewhere. With these careful considerations and costs in mind, let us use our close relationship with the empire's merchant class to ensure they shall not betray our ambitions and instead serve our interests beyond Constantinople."
 byz2_byzantine_silk_mission_title: "Byzantine Silk"
 byz2_byzantine_silk_mission_desc: "While the silk from the far east is the most popular and sought-after product of the Silk Road, we Byzantines have our own silk produced in Constantinople. As we continue to expand our borders as well as our political and economic influence, we shall be able to carve out our own Silk Road in the Mediterranean and beyond."
 byz2_the_bearded_ones_mission_title: "The Bearded Ones"
 byz2_the_bearded_ones_mission_desc: "The title of the 'Bearded Ones' refers to men granted purely honorific court titles, non-eunuchs who gained recognition without holding any actual office. However, as we continue to grow our bureaucracy and wage war, we will need more capable officials who are not dignified only in name. Thus, let us recruit new and true talents from the rising civil aristocracy to serve in our imperial court."
 byz2_war_through_diplomacy_mission_title: "War Through Diplomacy"
 byz2_war_through_diplomacy_mission_desc: "We Romans believe that diplomacy is simply a form of war by other means - why should Roman blood be shed when our interests and ambitions can be achieved through more clever means? Let us therefore treat foreign embassies especially well and invite members of the royal families of allies and subjects so the states and tribes on the periphery of the empire shall fight for our own political gain."
 byz2_strengthen_the_cavalry_mission_title: "Strengthen the Katafraktoi"
 byz2_strengthen_the_cavalry_mission_desc: "Since our wars with the Persians and Arabs in the east, our Romans armies evolved to meet the challenge. No longer infantry-focused as the Roman legions of old, our new Eastern Roman armies are supported by armored heavy cavalry, katafraktoi, along with other cavalry units such as the medium-armored koursorses or lightly-armored mounted archers. Let us hone our cavalry like a blade so it shall never break upon clashing with the cavalries of our enemies."
 byz2_military_reforms_mission_title: "Military Reforms"
 byz2_military_reforms_mission_desc: "One weakness of our military is how decentralized it is; as the provinces’ main payment to our state is through military service, local leaders throughout the empire are able to levy peasants in their regions, both for our campaigns as well as against us. To limit the power of these local leaders and ensure our armies serve only the interests of the emperor, we will need to make reforms to both our army as well as our administration and system of governance."
 byz2_armenian_subjects_mission_title: "Armenian Subjects"
 byz2_armenian_subjects_mission_desc: "The Armenians became religiously and politically isolated from the Roman Empire through their constant struggles against the invading Persians in the east, a divide that has only been exacerbated by the Islamic invasions. As Monophysites, the Armenians believe in Christianity yet follow a sect and church distinct from our own. It seems that to mend this schism, we will need to reintegrate Armenia as well as the surrounding kingdoms of the Caucauses into the Roman Empire."
 byz2_armenian_subjects_mission.tt: "Have the option to release §MArmenia§! as a §YMarch§! of [Root.GetName]"
 byz2_heraclius_woes_mission_title: "Heraclius' Woes"
 byz2_heraclius_woes_mission_desc: "The Emperor Heraclius had attempted to mend the schism between our own Church and those of the Monophysites and Nestorians in the east. Despite his best efforts and the initial cooperation of Monophysite and Nestorian leaders, Heraclius' dreams were ultimately unachieved. With the Monophysites now living under our own empire in Armenia, it shall hopefully be easier to reconcile past ecclesiastical disagreements."
 byz2_cultivate_alexandreia_mission_title: "Cultivate Alexandreia"
 byz2_cultivate_alexandreia_mission_desc: "Following the Islamic conquest of Egypt, Muslim rulers established new cities in the region such as Fustat, which they favored over the former Christian and intellectual center of Alexandreia. Having plundered Alexandreia of its riches, the Caliphs allowed the once great city to fall into decay. With Egypt now under our control, it is up to us to restore Alexandreia as a symbol of an ancient Christian, Roman and Greek legacy, overshadowing all of the cities built by the Islamic invaders."
 byz2_nova_romas_breadbasket_mission_title: "Nova Roma's Breadbasket"
 byz2_nova_romas_breadbasket_mission_desc: "Before Carthage became the primary source of grain for the Roman Empire, Rome had relied upon Egypt and the fertile fields of the Nile River as the main breadbasket of the empire. When the breadbasket of Africa was lost to the Vandals, however, the Eastern Roman Empire had to turn to Egypt once more. With Egypt now reconquered from Muslim rule, it is imperative that we restore the lands as Constantinople's breadbasket should future crises bring harm upon our empire."
 byz2_reconcile_african_faith_mission_title: "Reconcile African Faith"
 byz2_reconcile_african_faith_mission_desc: "The province of Africa has long been grounds for heretical struggle - from the Donatists of Carthage, to the Arian Vandals, to the Muslim rulers of today, it has been long since true orthodoxy has been allowed to thrive in Africa. With Roman Africa now in Roman hands once more, we can push for the permanent entrenchment of the true Christian doctrine in the region."

As our confederation is made up of the Sippe, an extended family unit made up of no more than 50 families, binding individuals together by oath rather than strictly by blood relation, we must be sure to earn the loyalty of the most prominent members of the Sippe."
 gertribe_rally_the_warbands_mission_title: "Rally the Warbands"
 gertribe_rally_the_warbands_mission_desc: "The backbone of our [Root.GetAdjective] army is made up of what the Romans call the comitatus, a retinue of warriors that follow and protect the chief of the [Root.GetAdjective] people.

This means that agriculture is not separate from our own population centers, as opposed to the urban and rural divide in the Roman Empire. This allows us to directly rely upon the agricultural productivity and livestock of the land. Thus, let us continue to promote and equally develop agriculture across our realm so we will never have to worry about food or supply, both in times of peace and war, ever again."
 gertribe_amber_trading_mission_title: "The Amber Road"
 gertribe_amber_trading_mission_desc: "One of our notable exports to the Roman Empire and beyond is amber, a fossilized tree resin that is known to us as 'glæsum.' This good has resulted in the establishment of trade routes between the Baltic and Mediterranean Seas, known as the Amber Road. Amber is first sourced in the shores of the Baltic Sea and is then traded to the tribes of Pannonia, from where it is subsequently exported further down south to the cities of Italy and the Mediterranean.
