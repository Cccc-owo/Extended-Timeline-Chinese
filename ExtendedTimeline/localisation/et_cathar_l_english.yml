 et_cathar.EVTNAME1:0 "Emergence of Catharism"
 et_cathar.EVTDESC1:0 "A recently emerged Christian movement known as Catharism has been gaining followers among the common folk in some of our provinces. The followers calling themselves Good Christians believe in a dualistic world with two divine beings, God the creator and satan the destroyer. Many Christians see this as antithetical to their monotheistic beliefs and the established Christian churches have denounced Catharism as heretical. The spread of this new religion could pose a threat on Papal authority in Europe if left unchecked."

 et_cathar.1.b:0 "It's not our business."
 et_cathar.EVTNAME2:0 "Spread of Catharism"
 et_cathar.EVTDESC2:0 "Catharism is slowly spreading in Western Europe through its followers. Unlike most forms of Christianity, Catharism allows women to serve as spiritual leaders which is helping it spread alomg women. The Cathars often find protection among the common people and are thus difficult to find and often get away with their actions against the Church."

 et_cathar.2.b:0 "Good."
 et_cathar.EVTNAME3:0 "Question of Reform"
 et_cathar.EVTDESC3:0 "While Catharism holds the key to many truths, some of its more extreme beliefs may not be practical to enforce over all of society.

Our secular advisors instruct us to reform the religion to tone down some of its more extreme beliefs."
 et_cathar.3.a:0 "Implement the reforms."
 et_cathar.3.b:0 "We shall not stray from the true faith."
 et_cathar.EVTNAME4:0 "Albigensian Crusade"
 et_cathar.EVTDESC4:0 "The heretical movement Catharism is spreading uncontrolled and converting many Christians to their ranks. The Pope as the head of Catholicism, the true faith, has to find the means to stop this heresy from spreading further. A crusade where all loyal Catholic rulers join together to defeat the Cathars could be an effective solution."
 et_cathar.4.a:0 "Call for a crusade!"
 et_cathar.4.b:0 "We should be more cautious."

 et_cathar.5.a:0 "Support the crusade."
 et_cathar.5.b:0 "It's not our business."
 cathar_aspect_endura: "Endura"
 desc_cathar_aspect_endura: "Sick or dying people who only decide at the end of their lives to receive the Consolamentum, but who no longer have the opportunity to live a strict ascetic life as Perfecti, can still save their souls by not eating any more food and thus starving to death."
 cathar_aspect_consolamentum: "Consolamentum"
 desc_cathar_aspect_consolamentum: "The Consolamentum is the crucial step in becoming a member of the Cathar Church and the only way to achieve salvation. If believers want to receive the consolamentum, they are required to prepare themselves in a kind of novitiate for the life of a Cathar. After the baptism the new member of the movement must live the rest of his life as a Cathar in order to attain salvation. Anyone who has received the consolamentum can pass it on, i.e. accept other people into the Cathar Church and thus save their souls."
