 HOLY_SITE_118_DESC:0 "As the capital city of the Roman Empire, Rome has been an important center from which Christianity has spread all over the Empire. The Church of Rome was founded and first organized by the two most glorious apostles, Peter and Paul. Rome is also the place where St. Peter and St. Paul suffered martyrdom at the hands of the Romans."
 HOLY_SITE_151_DESC:0 "Back when the city of Constantinople was still a minor town called Byzantium, what would later become the Church of Constantinople was founded there by St. Andrew, the First-Called and brother of St. Peter. Under Christian influence Constantinople grew into the capital of the empire in the east and became an important center of government and trade. Constantinople thus became invaluable in spreading Christianity in the eastern parts of the Roman Empire."

It is here that Jesus Christ made his Triumphal entry into Jerusalem, was thereafter crucified and buried, then resurrected and ascended into heaven. Moreover, Jerusalem is where the Church was first established, on the day of Pentecost as well as the place where the first Christian martyr, St. Stephen, was stoned to death and thus became the first martyr to die for Christianity. Finally, Jerusalem is also the place which saw the first ever Apostolic council."

The bishop of Merv was recognised as a metropolitan at the synod of Catholicos Mar Joseph in 554. The growing importance of the Merv region for the Church of the East is also attested by the appearance of several more nearby Christian centres during following centuries."
 HOLY_SITE_739_DESC:0 "For ages, Kashgar has been an important city along the silk road, acting as a gateway between China and the Middle East. Christianity spread here quickly after being established in the Merv region and Kasgar has since served as an entry point for Christianity to Mongolia and China. Later on, Kashgar also became a metropolitan see."
 HOLY_SITE_2269_DESC:0 "The Apostleship of Edessa is the oldest center of eastern Christianity, founded by St. Peter, St. Thomas and St. Bartholomew and first lead by St. Thaddeus, one of the seventy disciples, who was martyred in 66 AD."
