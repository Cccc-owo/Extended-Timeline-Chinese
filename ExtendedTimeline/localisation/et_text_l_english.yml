 HOLY_SITE_118_DESC:0 "As the capital city of the Roman Empire, Rome has been an important center from which Christianity has spread all over the Empire. The Church of Rome was founded and first organized by the two most glorious apostles, Peter and Paul. Rome is also the place where St. Peter and St. Paul suffered martyrdom at the hands of the Romans."
 HOLY_SITE_151_DESC:0 "Back when the city of Constantinople was still a minor town called Byzantium, what would later become the Church of Constantinople was founded there by St. Andrew, the First-Called and brother of St. Peter. Under Christian influence Constantinople grew into the capital of the empire in the east and became an important center of government and trade. Constantinople thus became invaluable in spreading Christianity in the eastern parts of the Roman Empire."
 HOLY_SITE_379_DESC:0 "The Church of Jerusalem was founded by the Apostles. It is here that Jesus Christ made his Triumphal entry into Jerusalem, was thereafter crucified and buried, then resurrected and ascended into heaven. Moreover, Jerusalem is where the Church was first established, on the day of Pentecost as well as the place where the first Christian martyr, St. Stephen, was stoned to death and thus became the first martyr to die for Christianity. Finally, Jerusalem is also the place which saw the first ever Apostolic council."
 HOLY_SITE_410_DESC:0 "The diocese of Seleucia-Ctesiphon was established in 280 in the capital of the Sassanid Empire when Papa bar Aggai was consecrated as a bishop and later took the title of Catholicos. Since then, Seleucia-Ctesiphon has been the provice of the Church of the East where the great metropolitan, head of all the bishops, sits."
 HOLY_SITE_445_DESC:0 "Merv became the seat of a bishop around the year 424 with Bar Shaba as its first bishop. His name means 'son of the deportation' suggesting that the Christians of Merv may have been deported from Roman lands. The bishop of Merv was recognised as a metropolitan at the synod of Catholicos Mar Joseph in 554. The growing importance of the Merv region for the Church of the East is also attested by the appearance of several more nearby Christian centres during following centuries."
 HOLY_SITE_451_DESC:0 "Kabul was one of the most prosperous and well defended cities of Afghanistan. And to the Zunbils, it also played a major role in the Zunist faith by the presence of several temples in the area, possibly Buddhist and Zunist ones. It stood as a bastion against Islam in the 7th and 8th century CE, culturally and politically Indian. It was captured finally in 870 and changed hands throughout the middle ages, regularly conquered by a rising empire and seeing its fall."
 HOLY_SITE_506_DESC:0 "Standing in the city of Multan is a solar temple of outmost importance for the Zunbils, dedicated to Surya, as one of the other names or homologue deities of Zhun would be Aditya (another name for Surya), the solar deity of Hinduism. The temple is an important place of pilgrimage and wealth and was already present in the 7th century CE and might have had Buddhist or Zoroastrian origins. It was destroyed in the late 10th century."
 HOLY_SITE_739_DESC:0 "For ages, Kashgar has been an important city along the silk road, acting as a gateway between China and the Middle East. Christianity spread here quickly after being established in the Merv region and Kasgar has since served as an entry point for Christianity to Mongolia and China. Later on, Kashgar also became a metropolitan see."
 HOLY_SITE_1947_DESC:0 "In Cenci rests the Arunachalesvara temple, devoted to the Hindu deity Shiva. Shiva has been thought to be another name for, or at the very least similar to, Zhun, the solar god of the Zunbils. Constructed possibly as early as the 1st century BCE, it stands as a place of worship for the aspect of fire, Agni, and was also certainly rebuilt or improved by the Chola in the 9th century CE, contemporary to the Zunbils."
 HOLY_SITE_2229_DESC:0 "The capital of Zabulistan, Bust, is the heart of its faith. Not much is known about the temples to Zhun, but a divine statue of Him lays on the sacred mountain close by and appears to have been brought here by the Hephthalites, tearing down an older god in its stead."
 HOLY_SITE_2269_DESC:0 "The Apostleship of Edessa is the oldest center of eastern Christianity, founded by St. Peter, St. Thomas and St. Bartholomew and first lead by St. Thaddeus, one of the seventy disciples, who was martyred in 66 AD."
 HOLY_SITE_2367_DESC:0 "Antioch, the Cradle of Christianity, was a center of Christianity during Roman times. The Church of Antioch was founded by St. Peter and when the early organization of the Church was developed, it became the seat of one of the five original patriarchates."
 HOLY_SITE_2673_DESC:0 "In Aksum stands The Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion, which was built in the 4th century during the reign of Ezana, the first Christian ruler of the ancient Aksumite empire. According to the legends it is here the great emperor Menelik I, son of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, brought the Ark of the Covenant after his journey to Jerusalem."
 HOLY_SITE_4326_DESC:0 "Near the mountains of Nishapur can be found the Adur Burzen-Mihr, a fire temple of Zoroastrianism dedicated to the farmer faction built in late 4th century BC and later operating under the reign of the Sassanids. The flame of the temple is thought to be linked to the cult of solar deities such as Zhun and Mithra."
