 et_brandenburg_polabia.1.t: "Establishment of the Northern March"
 et_brandenburg_polabia.1.d: "With many primarily Slavic territories now firmly under our control, we are faced with a decision on how to govern the new territories. Some advisors suggest that establishing a separate administration, with its own laws and regulations, would be a splendid idea. This would allow for greater autonomy and a more tailored approach to governing the region, potentially leading to greater economic growth and prosperity.\nHowever, others warn against decentralizing our domain, arguing that doing so could weaken the central government and lead to instability. They propose that the Northern March should be governed under the same laws and regulations as the rest of our domain, to ensure uniformity and strengthen our hold on the region. The decision is a weighty one, with potential ramifications for our nation's future."
 et_brandenburg_polabia.1.a: "A splendind idea!"
 NORDMARK: "Nordmark"
 et_brandenburg_polabia.1.b: "We shouldn't decentralise our domain."
 et_brandenburg_polabia.2.t: "Death of Margrave Gero"
 et_brandenburg_polabia.2.d: "The death of Margrave Gero has thrown the realm into turmoil, as factions vie for control of the land. Some advocate for splitting of the margraviate into smaller, more manageable territories, allowing for greater local control and autonomy. Others argue that maintaining the unity of the margraviate is crucial for the stability and prosperity of the realm, and should be enforced at all costs.\nA third faction suggests a compromise, in which the margraviate is divided into smaller territories, but with a central authority to coordinate and mediate disputes. This compromise could allow for greater local control while still maintaining a sense of unity and cohesion across the margraviate."
 et_brandenburg_polabia.2.a: "Allow for the split."
 et_brandenburg_polabia.2.b: "Try to enforce unity."
 et_brandenburg_polabia.2.c: "Settle on a compromise."
 et_brandenburg_polabia.3.t: "Pagans Split From the Empire!"
 et_brandenburg_polabia.3.d: "The news that some pagans have split from the Empire has rocked the foundations of our realm. This development is unacceptable, as it threatens the stability and unity of the Empire. Without a strong central authority to govern all the territories, we risk descending into chaos and infighting.\nWe must act swiftly and decisively to bring the pagans back into the fold, and reassert our authority over the entire Empire. Any other course of action would be a grave mistake."
 et_brandenburg_polabia.3.a: "Unacceptable!"
 et_brandenburg_polabia.4.t: "Great Lutician Revolt"
 et_brandenburg_polabia.4.d: "A great revolt of pagan slavs has erupted, threatening to tear our nation apart. As the rebels seize territory after territory, we are faced with a difficult decision on how to respond. Some advise that we offer concessions to the rebels, in an attempt to appease them and bring an end to the conflict. However, others argue that such concessions would only embolden the rebels and encourage further unrest.\nAnother faction suggests sending in the troops to crush the rebellion once and for all. While this option may be effective in the short term, it risks alienating the populace and sparking further resentment and unrest.\nA third option proposes abandoning most of our territory to the rebels and reorganizing our forces to secure the heartland of our nation. This would allow us to focus our efforts on the most vital areas and preserve the integrity of our nation, but at the cost of ceding significant territory to the rebels."
 et_brandenburg_polabia.4.a: "Offer concessions."
 et_brandenburg_polabia.4.b: "Send the troops!"
 et_brandenburg_polabia.4.c: "Abbandon most of the territory and reoragnise."

 et_brandenburg_polabia.5.d: "With the recent rise of the House of Ascania, we are faced with a decision regarding their role in the March. Some advisors suggest that the head of the Ascanian house would make a great margrave, with his leadership and military prowess being a valuable asset to our nation."

 et_brandenburg_polabia.6.d: "With the birth of Albrecht Achilles, the future of Ansbach is uncertain. Some advisors suggest that with his lineage as an heir of Brandenburg, Albrecht Achilles could be the key to securing closer ties between our two realms. They propose that we should groom him for leadership, and work towards a potential union between Ansbach and Brandenburg."
