 ita_appease_senate_mission_desc:0 "With the city and its surrounding lands under the direct control of our king, we must now look to appease the Roman Court that we have taken over. In order to gain their cooperation and ensure smooth governance and greater political stability, we must do whatever means necessary, whether through favors or temporary decreased autonomy, even if it hurts our own reputation, to keep the Roman Senate loyal to the Kingdom of Italy."

 ita_accept_chalcedonism_mission_desc:0 "The official Christian canon of the Roman Empire was decided at the Council of Chalcedon a few decades ago.

 ayu_conquer_malacca_mission_desc:0 "The port city of Malacca has grown increasingly valuable over time.

 ven_fortify_domini_da_mar_mission_title:1 "Fortify Domini da Mar"
 ven_fortify_domini_da_mar_mission_desc:0 "While we hold many lands far from the Terraferma, there are many envious powers who wish to take these lands from us through whatever means necessary. We must establish fortifications throughout our dominion, beyond Venetia, to defend our trade routes along friendly territories as well as the people who inhabit them."
 ven_armata_di_venesia_mission_title:1 "Armata di Venesia"
 ven_armata_di_venesia_mission_desc:0 "The sheer distance between the shores of our dominions leave us vulnerable to multi-pronged attacks from any coalition that wishes us harm. Thus, let us establish a great armada to defend our lands from any corner of the world, and destroy all who wish to oppose us before they even make landfall."
 ven_supremazia_serenissima_mission_title:1 "Supremazia Serenissima"
 ven_supremazia_serenissima_mission_desc:0 "As our power grows, so does our prosperity at home. As a result, Venice is truly one of the greatest cities in the world. Of course, such claims are often contested by jealous rivals; therefore, we must acquire the gold to back this claim of ours."
 ven_seize_morea_mission_title:1 "Seize Morea"
 ven_seize_morea_mission_desc:0 "The Greek peninsula of Morea is of great strategic importance to the Repùblica. It will not only protect our trade interests in the eastern Mediterranean and Aegean Seas, but provide us a foothold in Greece for the eastern expansion of our sphere of influence."
 ven_the_fourth_crusade_mission_title:1 "The Fourth Crusade"
 ven_the_fourth_crusade_mission_desc:0 "The city of Constantinople, nicknamed and recognized by many as the 'City of the World's Desire.' Our economic rivals, the Byzantines, continue to use its wealth against us. We must wait until an opportunity presents itself so that we may take the city from the arrogant Emperor and establish ourselves as the sole maritime power of the eastern Mediterranean!"
 ven_influence_the_holy_see_mission_title:1 "Influence the Holy See"
 ven_influence_the_holy_see_mission_desc:0 "Our relations with the Pope have been uncertain in the best of times and have led to open hostilities in the worst. Although we could simply reestablish diplomatic relations with the Pope, what better way is there to ensure the loyalty of Roma than to control the state from within the Church itself?"
