Thus, should we acquire enough renown as well as bargaining power with the court, we would be able to petition for the acquisition of a court rank that shall serve our best interests.\n\n§TThis Decision can be taken more than once to increase the current ruler's court rank, with the prestige requirement increasing with each promotion in rank.
